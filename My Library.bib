	abstract = {Many researchers and policymakers from various disciplines highlight the role of urban biodiversity in delivering ecosystem services to enhance human wellbeing in a rapidly urbanising world. This suggests powerful synergies between approaches that are often disciplinarily separated, aiming either at human wellbeing or biodiversity conservation. Strategies towards liveable and biodiverse cities would gain support from insights into the people-biodiversity interface in cities. Yet, the question of which scale of biodiversity (from ecosystems to genes) benefits urban people in general and different socio-cultural groups in particular, remains largely open. To assess the current scientific knowledge as well as potential for further research, we systematically reviewed literature on people's perception and valuation of urban biodiversity (200 studies). We also quantified the outcomes of studies in terms of the effects of biodiversity on valuation for studies that addressed biodiversity valuation below the ecosystem scale. We found that the current literature is critically biased in four ways. (1) Most studies cover temperate climates, while regions with the most pronounced urban growth are underrepresented. (2) Studies focus on urban forests and parks while important informal greenspaces are largely neglected. (3) Biodiversity is mostly addressed at the ecosystem scale (habitat or land-use types) while diversity at the species community or gene scale key issues in biodiversity conservation is covered to a much lesser extent. Most studies below the ecosystem scale show positive biodiversity effects, but universal patterns are not apparent due to the scarcity and low comparability of research. (4) Almost no studies consider the cultural diversity of urban residents by systematically targeting people from different socio-economic and cultural backgrounds or specific age groups. Our review reveals critical knowledge gaps about the people-biodiversity interface in cities, both in approaching cultural and biological diversity ('biocultural diversity'). This shows unexploited opportunities and future directions in linking usually separated strategies on enhancing human wellbeing and biodiversity conservation in sustainable cities.

Throughout the research, biodiversity is operationally represented by a "green coverage ratio", while standardised data on land and rent prices are used to assess the value of residential areas. The results confirm that the green coverage ratio and housing value are correlated. The study concludes that there is a need for development of a more accurate and integrated policy database that will provide explicit definitions of management targets, locations and clients for promotion of green space in Tokyo.},

	abstract = {The global decline in biodiversity as a result of urbanization remains poorly understood. Whereas habitat destruction accounts for losses at the species level, it may not explain diversity loss at the community level, because urban centers also attract synanthropic species that do not necessarily exist in wildlands. Here we suggest an alternative framework for understanding this phenomenon: the competitive exclusion of native, nonsynanthropic species by invasive species. We use data from two urban centers (Phoenix and Baltimore) and two taxa (birds and spiders) to link diversity loss with reduced community evenness among species in urban communities. This reduction in evenness may be caused by a minority of invasive species dominating the majority of the resources, consequently excluding nonsynanthropic species that could otherwise adapt to urban conditions. We use foraging efficiency as a mechanism to explain the loss of diversity. Thus, to understand the effects of habitat conversion on biodiversity, and to sustain species-rich communities, future research should give more attention to interspecific interactions in urban settings.},

	abstract = {Efforts at mitigating global biodiversity loss have often focused on preserving large, intact natural habitats. However, preserving biodiversity should also be an important goal in the urban environment, especially in highly urbanized areas where little natural habitat remains. Increasingly, research at the city/county scale as well as at the landscape scale reveals that urban areas can contain relatively high levels of biodiversity. Important percentages of species found in the surrounding natural habitat, including endangered species, have been found in the urban forest. This contribution concisely highlights some examples of urban biodiversity research from various areas of the world. Key issues involved in understanding the patterns and processes that affect urban biodiversity, such as the urban–rural gradient and biotic homogenization, are addressed. The potential for urban areas to harbor considerable amounts of biodiversity needs to be recognized by city planners and urban foresters so that management practices that preserve and promote that diversity can be pursued. Management options should focus on increasing biodiversity in all aspects of the urban forest, from street trees to urban parks and woodlots.},

Urban green spaces are critical habitats to support biodiversity, but we still have a limited understanding of their ecology and how they function to conserve biodiversity at local and landscape scales across multiple taxa. Given this limited view, we discuss five key questions that need to be addressed to advance the ecology of urban green spaces for biodiversity conservation and restoration. Specifically, we discuss the need for research to understand how green space size, connectedness, and type influence the community, population, and life-history dynamics of multiple taxa in cities. A research framework based in landscape and metapopulation ecology will allow for a greater understanding of the ecological function of green spaces and thus allow for planning and management of green spaces to conserve biodiversity and aid in restoration activities.},

	abstract = {The concept of green infrastructure is widely used in environmental planning, but so far it has no standard definition. Planners, conservationists and scientists tend to welcome the term because it can serve as a boundary object, providing links among policy makers, developers and different academic disciplines. However, the concept of green infrastructure creates risks for biodiversity conservation in its adoption. It can be used to water down biodiversity conservation aims and objectives as easily as it can be used to further them because of the different ideas associated with it and the multiple interests pursued. In this paper, we address such risks by looking, among others, at the European Union’s Green Infrastructure Strategy and we suggest how planners and conservationists might deal with its growing importance in environmental policy and planning to enhance its value for biodiversity conservation.},

	abstract = {There is growing recognition of urban areas as hosts for innovative ways to conserve and promote biodiversity. Parks, as one specific type of urban green space, constitute particularly important biodiversity hotspots in the cityscape. We reviewed empirical findings on the species richness in urban parks across all species groups that have been studied. The aim was to assess and discuss the overall species richness of urban parks, its community attributes and drivers. Search and subsequent selection process resulted in 62 papers from 25 different countries. For all examined species groups, the findings consistently show that parks are among the most species rich types of urban green spaces, but also that exotics constitute large shares, especially of plant species. Key ecological theories like the gradient approach and the island habitat ecological theory, and fundamental ecological relationships such as the species-area relationship are valid despite the manipulated ‘nature’ of parks and the surrounding urban matrix. Most studies surveyed large number of parks and applied ‘multi-scale’ approaches in tests of confounding variables, providing methodological strength. While matrix effects are consistently found to affect species richness negatively, the diversity of habitats and microhabitat heterogeneity contained in urban parks appears as the most decisive factor for the overall species richness. However, a constraint of research to date is the limitation of individual studies to one or a few species groups, rarely bridging between flora and fauna. Adopting ‘multi-species group’ approaches in future research is needed to further advance the understanding of the overall biodiversity of urban parks, and its drivers.},

	abstract = {In many European cities, urban gardens are seen as increasingly important components of urban green space networks. We adopt an ecosystem services framework to assess contributions of urban gardens to the quality of of their users. First, we identify and characterize ecosystem services provided by urban gardens. Secondly, we assess the demographic and socioeconomic profile of its beneficiaries and the relative importance they attribute to different ecosystem services. Next we discuss the relevance of our results in relation to critical policy challenges, such as the promotion of societal cohesion and healthy lifestyles. Data were collected through 44 semi-structured interviews and a survey among 201 users of 27 urban gardens in Barcelona, Spain, as well as from consultation meetings with local planners. We identified 20 ecosystem services, ranging from food production over pollination to social cohesion and environmental learning. Among them, cultural ecosystem services (non-material benefits people derive from their interaction with nature) ​ stand out as the most widely perceived and as the most highly valued. The main beneficiaries of ecosystem services from urban gardens are elder, low-middle income, and migrant people. Our results about the societal importance of urban gardens ​were deemed highly relevant by the interviewed green space planners in Barcelona, who noted that our data can provide basis to support or expand existing gardening programs in the city. Our research further suggests that ecosystem services from urban gardens can play an important role in addressing several urban policy challenges in cities, such as promoting stewardship of urban ecosystems, providing opportunities for recreation and healthy lifestyles, and promoting social cohesion. We conclude that urban gardens and associated ecosystem services can play an important ​ in urban policies aimed at enhancing quality of life in cities, particularly if access to their benefits is expanded to larger segments of the population.},

CBI databases are being constructed as global platforms, though the available dataset is limited. The land-use dataset is one of the datasets that can be utilized to apply the CBI on the national level in countries including Japan. To demonstrate the importance and potential of the CBI under the limitation of the available dataset, we attempted to apply the CBI to the 791 Japanese cities by using available land-use indicators, and categorized the cities based on the indicators. The focus of the CBI is self-assessment, but we propose that grouping of cities with similar profiles is possible and can serve as a basis for potential collaboration. Coordinating policies on various scales is necessary in order to enhance biodiversity on a global scale; one option is to increase collaboration among cities. As a result, we found three groups with similar characteristics amongst cities with forests, paddies, and croplands as major compositions in terms of biodiversity. These findings will contribute to policy formation and efficient information sharing for ecosystem services management.},

	abstract = {By 2050, 70\% of the Earth's human population will live in urban areas. Urbanization can have a devastating impact on local ecosystems, but these impacts vary across time and space. Identifying links between spatiotemporal change in urban ecosystems and neighborhood socio-economics is crucial to management aimed at maintaining flora and fauna in urban areas. Here, we tracked 20 years of socio-economic change and 15 years of vegetation change in 32 residential neighborhoods in south-eastern Australia. Regression models that explicitly accounted for a time lag between neighborhood socio-economic characteristics and vegetation response explained more variation in vegetation cover than models that ignored the effects of time. Also, relationships between vegetation and socio-economic factors were stronger in later years for the same neighborhoods suggesting the influence of socio-economics is more readily identified in established neighborhoods. Socio-economic variables alone, or in combination with biophysical variables, were better predictors of vegetation cover than only biophysical variables. Across space, vegetation cover had a negative quadratic relationship with neighborhood housing density, peaking at mid-density values, and a positive relationship with education level and immigration status (the percentage of residents with a non-Australian background). Over time, housing density had a positive relationship with vegetation cover, reflecting an increase in vegetation as neighborhoods develop. Our results highlight the need to understand temporal context when attempting to explain contemporary patterns in vegetation cover and the increasing importance of socio-economic factors in influencing cover as neighborhoods become established.},

	abstract = {Urbanization is recognized as one of the greatest threats to biodiversity throughout the world. However, the vegetation within an urbanized landscape is diverse and includes a variety of native and exotic plant species. This variation allows for testing whether certain landscape designs outperform others in the support of native biodiversity. Residential yards represent a large component of an urban landscape and, if managed collectively for birds and other wildlife, could offset some of the negative effects of urbanization. In addition, many urbanites have their primary interaction with the natural world in their front and back yards. Therefore, ensuring positive wildlife experiences for them is essential in promoting urban biodiversity. At the Central Arizona–Phoenix Long‐Term Ecological Research site we tested the efficacy of native landscaping in residential yards in attracting native birds. We also explored the links between socioeconomic factors, landscape designs, and urban gradient measurements with the urban bird communities. A redundancy analysis suggested that native desert bird species increased in abundance in neighborhoods with desert landscaping designs, neighborhoods closer to large desert tracts, and higher‐income neighborhoods. Variance partitioning showed that collectively these three sets of environmental variables explained almost 50\% of the variation in the urban bird community. Results suggested racial and economic inequities in access to biodiversity, whereby predominantly Hispanic and lower‐income neighborhoods had fewer native birds. We also found that residents' satisfaction with bird diversity was positively correlated with actual bird diversity. Our study provides new insights into the relative importance of socioeconomic variables and common urban ecological measurements in explaining urban bird communities. Urban planners can use this information to develop residential landscapes that support the well‐being of both birds and people.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims
The botanic gardens of the world are now unmatched ex situ collections of plant biodiversity. They mirror two biogeographical patterns (positive diversity–area and diversity–age relationships) but differ from nature with a positive latitudinal gradient in their richness. Whether these relationships can be explained by socio-economic factors is unknown.

Methods
Species and taxa richness of a comprehensive sample of botanic gardens were analysed as a function of key ecological and socio-economic factors using (a) multivariate models controlling for spatial autocorrelation and (b) structural equation modelling.

Key Results
The number of plant species in botanic gardens increases with town human population size and country Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per person. The country flora richness is not related to the species richness of botanic gardens. Botanic gardens in more populous towns tend to have a larger area and can thus host richer living collections. Botanic gardens in richer countries have more species, and this explains the positive latitudinal gradient in botanic gardens' species richness.

Conclusions
Socio-economic factors contribute to shaping patterns in the species richness of the living collections of the world's botanic gardens.},

	abstract = {The patterns of biodiversity changes in cities are now fairly well established, although diversity changes in temperate cities are much better studied than cities in other climate zones. Generally, plant species richness often increases in cities due to importation of exotic species, whereas animal species richness declines. Abundances of some groups, especially birds and arthropods, often increase in urban areas despite declines in species richness. Although several models have been proposed for biodiversity change, the processes underlying the patterns of biodiversity in cities are poorly understood. We argue that humans directly control plants but relatively few animals and microbes-the remaining biological community is determined by this plant "template" upon which natural ecological and evolutionary processes act. As a result, conserving or reconstructing natural habitats defined by vegetation within urban areas is no guarantee that other components of the biological community will follow suit. Understanding the human-controlled and natural processes that alter biodiversity is essential for conserving urban biodiversity. This urban biodiversity will comprise a growing fraction of the world's repository of biodiversity in the future.},

	abstract = {We examined the biodiversity of urban habitats in Birmingham (England) using a combination of field surveys of plants and carabid beetles, genetic studies of four species of butterflies, modelling the anthropochorous nature of the floral communities and spatially explicit modelling of selected mammal species. The aim of the project was to: (i) understand the ecological characteristics of the biota of cities model, (ii) examine the effects of habitat fragment size and connectivity upon the ecological diversity and individual species distributions, (iii) predict biodiversity in cities, and (iv) analyse the extent to which the flora and fauna utilise the 'urban greenways' both as wildlife corridors and as habitats in their own right. The results suggest that cities provide habitats for rich and diverse range of plants and animals, which occur sometimes in unlikely recombinant communities. The studies on carabids and butterflies illustrated the relative importance of habitat quality on individual sites as opposed to site location within the conurbation. This suggests that dispersal for most of our urban species is not a limiting factor in population persistence, although elements of the woodland carabid fauna did appear to have some geographical structuring. Theoretical models suggested that dormice and water voles may depend on linear habitats for dispersal. The models also indicated that other groups, such as small and medium sized mammals, may use corridors, although field-based research did not provide any evidence to suggest that plants or invertebrates use urban greenways for dispersal. This finding indicates the importance of identifying a target species or group of species for urban greenways intended as dispersal routeways rather than as habitat in their own right. Their importance for most groups is rather that greenways provide a chain of different habitats permeating the urban environment. We suggest that planners can have a positive impact on urban biodiversity by slowing the pace of redevelopment and by not hurrying to tidy up and redevelop brownfield sites.},

	abstract = {Urban heat islands (UHIs) represent a serious problem for urban biodiversity and landscapes. The impact of UHIs on Japanese gardens are of particular concern because these gardens use moss as a ground cover, and moss can be strongly affected by UHIs due to their sensitivity to drought stress. We studied 17 historical gardens in Kyoto, Japan, and propose an effective management strategy for moss gardens that takes into account the influence of UHIs on these gardens. The study sites included gardens covered by large patches of hygrophilous moss, gardens covered by mosses including small patches of hygrophilous moss, gardens covered by relatively drought-resistant moss, and gardens with small patches of mosses. We measured temperature and relative humidity within the gardens and determined the surrounding land-use types. A comparison of microclimates showed significant differences among garden types. Hygrophilous gardens had the lowest temperature and highest relative humidity, whereas gardens with small patches of moss had the highest temperature and lowest relative humidity. Using structural equation models, we determined that urbanization within 1000 m from the gardens increased temperature and decreased relative humidity, strongly affecting the type of garden. These effects could be attributed to the sensitivity of mosses to changes in microclimate caused by UHIs. Taken together, the results indicate that urban planning—e.g., increasing green space—within 1000 m of moss gardens can maintain those gardens by mitigating the influence of UHIs.},

In many countries, private gardens are a major component of urban green space and can provide considerable biodiversity benefits. Gardens and adjacent habitats form interconnected networks and a landscape ecology framework is necessary to understand the relationship between the spatial configuration of garden patches and their constituent biodiversity. A scale-dependent tension is apparent in garden management, whereby the individual garden is much smaller than the unit of management needed to retain viable populations. To overcome this, here we suggest mechanisms for encouraging 'wildlife-friendly' management of collections of gardens across scales from the neighbourhood to the city.},

	abstract = {With increasing urbanization the importance of cities for biodiversity conservation grows. This paper reviews the ways in which biodiversity is affected by urbanization and discusses the consequences of different conservation approaches. Cities can be richer in plant species, including in native species, than rural areas. Alien species can lead to both homogenization and differentiation among urban regions. Urban habitats can harbor self-sustaining populations of rare and endangered native species, but cannot replace the complete functionality of (semi-)natural remnants. While many conservation approaches tend to focus on such relict habitats and native species in urban settings, this paper argues for a paradigm shift towards considering the whole range of urban ecosystems. Although conservation attitudes may be challenged by the novelty of some urban ecosystems, which are often linked to high numbers of nonnative species, it is promising to consider their associated ecosystem services, social benefits, and possible contribution to biodiversity conservation.},

	abstract = {Although urban green spaces are increasingly important both for humans and wildlife, an increase in urban green spaces may also increase human–wildlife conflicts in urban areas. However, few studies have examined the relationship between the size of green spaces and the level of conflicts with wildlife in multiple taxa, including invertebrates and vertebrates. To better understand current pest statistics and predict changes that will occur as the area of green spaces increases, we analysed a dataset compiling the number of pest consultations in 53 metropolitan districts in Tokyo over a 20-year period and its relationships with the area of green space. Stinging insects (e.g., wasps) made up over 50\% of pest consultations, followed (in order) by rats and other nuisance animals (e.g., snakes). The number of consultations per unit population did not correlate, or was even negatively correlated, with the proportions of green spaces (mainly forest) for many indoor pests, but did positively correlate for some outdoor pests, such as wasps and snakes. Therefore, wasps and snakes can increase when urban green spaces increase. Because even minor nuisances are relevant for urban lifestyles, considerations of ways to minimise conflicts with wildlife are critical for urban green space management.},

Although most measures of ecosystem performance declined with increasing urban density, there was considerable variability in the relationships. This suggests that at any given density, there is substantial scope for maximising ecological performance. The social status of residents was related to measures of tree cover. Housing type was significantly associated with some types of ecosystem service provision, indicating that the type of development may be important independent of its density. These findings have implications for understanding the distribution of ecosystem services and biodiversity across urban landscapes, and the management of development aimed at meeting UK government housing density targets.},

	abstract = {随着中国城市化进程的快速推进,城市发展与生态环境之间的矛盾也不断显现。大量关于城市植物多样性的研究结果表明城市化是引起植物多样性格局变化的主要原因之一。目前我国的研究普遍注意到环境因子对植物物种多样性格局的影响。然而,由于城市环境格局的差异以及研究目的的需要,对各个城市的研究方法仍然不尽相同。此外,以往的研究主要侧重于城市植物物种多样性方面的评估,对功能多样性和谱系多样性层面所受到的影响仍需要进一步探索。本研究以海南省海口市城市区域的植被为研究对象,以群落学调查数据为基础,量化证明了城市边界划定对植物多样性评估的影响;分析了城市发展水平、土地利用方式和管理经营模式等对植物多样性格局的驱动作用;探讨了城市环境中植物多样性指数的相关性和适用性。具体研究成果如下:1、在使用相同样方设置和调查方法的前提下,对海口市建成区和规划区分别进行了样方调查及植物多样性对比,结果表明城市边界的划定会对植物多样性评估产生明显影响,建成区调查的物种丰富度结果远高于规划区。不同角度(物种、功能和谱系)多样性指数都由于城市边界划定的不同而有所差异。本研究认为在对比不同城市的植物多样性时,需考虑到城市边界划定的对等性。2、海口市建成区中共统计到770种维管束植物,隶属143科502属。其中有乔木229种,灌木238种,草本303种。乡土物种398种,外来种372种。主要科包括大戟科、棕榈科、禾本科、桃金娘科和豆科等。基调树种包含椰子、印度紫檀、王棕、垂叶榕、小叶榕、非洲楝、黄金榕、龙船花、散尾葵和扶桑等。海口城市森林的空间分布较为单一,且整体立木层次偏低,城市森林还在初期的建设阶段。植物栽植养护过程中的物种存活率,是形成优良可持续的城市植物群落结构的重要保证。3、城市环境中单一角度的多样性指标间基本都存在显著相关性。物种多样性和功能多样性之间也存在显著相关性。谱系多样性指标与另外两个角度(物种、功能)的多样性指标间呈现显著相关性的指标较少。功能多样性与谱系多样性间的解耦现象跟选取的功能性状指标有关。两个指标之间是否相关是由于指标公式中对物种丰富度和多度的考量是否一致所导致的。因此,选取合适的指标体系是准确解读城市植物多样性格局的重要前提。4、在同样的城市边界标准以及同样的取样方式的情况下,相同文化背景且地理位置邻近城市的物种丰富度水平基本没有差异。但是对植物物种组成的影响强烈。发展水平越高的城市,外来种的使用比例也相应的越高。城市发展水平对乔木层的植物多样性几乎没有影响,而灌木层和草本层的植物多样性呈现了显著差异。因此,一个城市在其发展历程中,改变最为明显的是植物种类的组成,但是其物种、功能和谱系多样性在较短的发展历程中会处于较稳定的状态。5、不同干扰强度和干扰方式的地块中,植物多样性呈现显著差异。强干扰程度的土地利用类型通常具备较高的物种多样性和功能多样性,但是物种的亲缘关系并未产生对应的变化。此外,土地利用方式还会对不同生活型的植物多样性产生不同程度的影响。比如强度干扰的交通用地中偏低的物种和功能多样性,以及弱度干扰的空闲地中草本层较高的物种和功能多样性。6、海口市高尔夫球场和综合性公园的植物多样性比较显示,不同的管理经营模式的公共绿地仍会造成植物多样性的差异,这种差异是对经济效益的考虑和对服务功能的需求引起的。高尔夫球场在灌木层的功能丰富度方面低于综合性公园,而物种丰富度上却高于综合性公园。物种形态特征方面的差别是导致这一反差的主要原因。因为球场灌木植被的功能需求较为单一,且景观方面的需求往往通过乔木层体现。大型综合性公园比高尔夫球场拥有更高的外来种比例,提升公园中本地种的物种数和多度是体现当地公园特色,降低植物群落养护成本的重要措施。本研究不仅丰富了城市植物多样性研究的理论基础,同时也完善了其研究框架,为城市植物多样性的保护和发展提供了科技支撑。},

	abstract = {Fragmentation of habitat is recognised as the number one threat to biodiversity and as such has attracted considerable research. However, much of this research has been conducted in forestry and agricultural environments, with little research in urban areas. In this study, Weld surveys were conducted measuring the impact of fragmentation on bird, frog, plant and fungi species richness, within the fragmented urban landscape of southern Sydney. Of all fragmentation parameters examined, remnant area was the best and most signiWcant predictor of species richness for all taxa studied. Remnant size thresholds, below which biodiversity declined rapidly, were observed at approximately 4 ha for bird and frog species richness and approximately 2 ha for plant and fungal species richness. A further threshold appears to exist at approximately 50 ha for the dominance of forest interior species. Further relationships were also observed for perimeter:area ratio, indicating the inXuence of various edge eVects on all taxa. Isolation eVects were observed in the form of an inverse linear relationship between distance to other large reserves and species richness for fungi, birds and frogs. Corridor connectivity also produced an overall positive relationship for birds, frogs and plants. It is concluded that the identiWcation of fragmentation thresholds and relationships provides an important management tool for the design of networks aimed at conserving biodiversity in fragmented urban environments.},

This framework was mostly limited to quantitative traits without missing values and to situations in which there are more species than traits, although the authors had suggested a way to extend their framework to other trait types. The main purpose of this note is to further develop this suggestion. We describe a highly ﬂexible distance-based framework to measure different facets of FD in multidimensional trait space from any distance or dissimilarity measure, any number of traits, and from different trait types (i.e., quantitative, semi-quantitative, and qualitative). This new approach allows for missing trait values and the weighting of individual traits. We also present a new multidimensional FD index, called functional dispersion (FDis), which is closely related to Rao’s quadratic entropy. FDis is the multivariate analogue of the weighted mean absolute deviation (MAD), in which the weights are species relative abundances. For unweighted presence–absence data, FDis can be used for a formal statistical test of differences in FD. We provide the ‘‘FD’’ R language package to easily implement our distance-based FD framework.},

	abstract = {Urban greenspaces are universally valued as amenity-recreation venues, wildlife refuges and essential livable-city ingredients. Western strategies of urban greenspace provision are difficult to implement or retrofit in most Asian cities, commonly constrained by a high-density compact form. With recent rapid urbanization and associated brown and green field developments, ample opportunities arise to overhaul greenspace standards and patterns. The case study of the ancient city of Nanjing in China permits planning for an integrated greenspace network, aiming at flexibility for future urban expansion, green field acquisition, recreational functions, wildlife habitats and environmental benefits. It consists of green wedges, greenways and green extensions that incorporate urban green areas at three landscape scales. At the metropolis scale, through normative and substantive analyses of urban form and urban expansion, and assessment of suburban uplands, five green wedges are demarcated to generate a star urban form. The green wedges link the extensive countryside to the central city, and define elongated finger-like spaces between them for urban expansion to avoid conflicts with green fields. At the city scale, three major greenways, including city-wall circular greenway, Inner-Qinhuai River greenway, and canopy-road greenway, are designed as a permeating framework to guide new greenspace location, configuration and continuity, and to link existing parks. These greenways are equipped with a comprehensive trail system to foster pedestrian and cycling movements that are preferred by the public and the government. At the neighborhood scale, a greenspace organization, consisting of residential public open spaces, shaded sidewalks and riparian strips, conforms to the network geometry. As well-connected entities, these small proximate enclaves provide opportunities for residents to have day-to-day contact with nature. They also serve to resist undue urban influences and intrusions. Overall, the three-tiered greenspace system provides an alternative mode for urban development to the conventional transport-dominated one, to usher substantial improvement in landscape-environmental quality and to augment the sustainable-city notion.},

Drivers of garden diversity and structure are complex, reflecting the diversity of social, cultural, and socioeconomic characteristics of the householders who manage their gardens, as well as their predecessors. Here we investigate the woodiness of gardens, and focus on (1) the prevalence of native versus exotic woody plants and (2) the influence of characteristics of garden owners, the gardens, and their proximity to neighborhood green spaces to identify the degree to which these factors explain patterns in native and exotic woody species communities in entire (back and front) gardens in southern temperate New Zealand. We found few consistent patterns in structure in woody species community composition. Outlying gardens were characterized by low species richness and abundance. Thirty-seven species commonly occurred across most gardens: most of these were exotic. Twelve native species were common throughout most gardens. There was significant but weak matching to social and environmental variables: vegetated area, species knowledge, and education explained pattern in native communities, whereas vegetated area, species knowledge, and householder age explained variation in exotic communities. Native trees {\textgreater} 5 m tall occurred in only 58\% of gardens. Tall tree density was 10/ha, and 29\% of gardens lacked any trees {\textgreater} 5 m. Tree presence was weakly (positively) associated with extent and proximity of neighborhood green space. We suggest that the legacy of previous owners’ gardening practices is important to consider when identifying drivers of garden plant community structure.},

Understanding how urban development, both in terms of socio-economic status and the built environment, affects biodiversity can contribute to the sustainable development of cities, and may be especially important in the developing world where current growth in urban populations is most rapid. We tested the Luxury Effect by analysing bird species richness in relation to income levels, as well as human population density and urban cover, in landscapes along an urbanization gradient in South Africa. The Luxury Effect was supported in landscapes with lower urbanization levels in that species richness was positively correlated with income level where urban cover was relatively low. However, the effect was reversed in highly urbanized landscapes, where species richness was negatively associated with income level. Tree cover was also positively correlated with species richness, although it could not explain the Luxury Effect. Species richness was negatively related to urban cover, but there was no association with human population density. Our model suggests that maintaining green space in at least an equal proportion to the built environment is likely to provide a development strategy that will enhance urban biodiversity, and with it, the positive benefits that are manifest for urban dwellers. Our findings can form a key contribution to a wider strategy to expand urban settlements in a sustainable way to provide for the growing urban population in South Africa, including addressing imbalances in environmental justice across income levels and racial groups.},

However, urbanization can be catastrophic for native species, and is a well-known threat to biodiversity worldwide. Urbanization impacts can be mitigated by urban design and development improvements, but take-up of these practices has been slow. There is an urgent need to incorporate existing ecological knowledge into a framework that can be used by planners and developers to ensure that biodiversity conservation is considered in decision-making processes. Here, we distill the urban biodiversity literature into five principles for biodiversity sensitive urban design (BSUD), ranging from creating habitat and promoting dispersal to facilitating community stewardship. We then present a framework for implementing BSUD aimed at delivering onsite benefits to biodiversity, and that is applicable across a range of urban development types and densities. We illustrate the application of the BSUD framework in two case studies focusing on the: (1) protection of an endangered vegetation remnant in a new low-density subdivision; and (2) persistence of an endangered reptile in an established suburban environment.},

	abstract = {Summary 1 With the majority of people now living in urban environments, urbanization is arguably the most intensive and irreversible ecosystem change on the planet. 2 Urbanization transforms floras through a series of filters that change: (i) habitat availability; (ii) the spatial arrangement of habitats; (iii) the pool of plant species; and (iv) evolutionary selection pressures on populations persisting in the urban environment. 3 Using a framework based on mechanisms of change leads to specific predictions of floristic change in urban environments. Explicitly linking drivers of floristic change to predicted outcomes in urban areas can facilitate sustainable management of urban vegetation as well as the conservation of biodiversity. 4 Synthesis. We outline how the use of our proposed framework, based on environmental filtering, can be used to predict responses of floras to urbanization. These floristic responses can be assessed using metrics of taxonomic composition, phylogenetic relatedness among species, plant trait distributions or plant community structure. We outline how this framework can be applied to studies that compare floras within cities or among cities to better understand the various floristic responses to urbanization.},

	abstract = {The question, “why do areas vary in species richness?” has been important throughout the history of ecology. It is difficult to answer definitively because we have so many (at least 120) plausible hypotheses. This abundance of hypotheses has led to a number of attempts to classify them. Unfortunately, richness hypotheses often defy such categorization. Instead of placing species richness hypotheses into categories, I suggest an alternative approach: to treat species richness hypotheses as violations of the assumptions of Gause’s Competitive Exclusion Principle. This is a very similar approach to the pedagogy of population genetics: evolution occurs if and only if at least one assumption of the Hardy-Weinberg principle is violated. The classification of hypotheses advocated here treats interspecific competition as a central organizing concept in community theory. However, it does not treat competition as an organizing concept in communities: indeed, the relaxation or disruption of competition is considered to be the status quo in the majority of communities.},

	abstract = {Urbanization contributes to the loss of the world's biodiversity and the homogenization of its biota. However, comparative studies of urban biodiversity leading to robust generalities of the status and drivers of biodiversity in cities at the global scale are lacking. Here, we compiled the largest global dataset to date of two diverse taxa in cities: birds (54 cities) and plants (110 cities). We found that the majority of urban bird and plant species are native in the world's cities. Few plants and birds are cosmopolitan, the most common being Columba livia and Poa annua. The density of bird and plant species (the number of species per km2) has declined substantially: only 8\% of native bird and 25\% of native plant species are currently present compared with estimates of non-urban density of species. The current density of species in cities and the loss in density of species was best explained by anthropogenic features (landcover, city age) rather than by non-anthropogenic factors (geography, climate, topography). As urbanization continues to expand, efforts directed towards the conservation of intact vegetation within urban landscapes could support higher concentrations of both bird and plant species. Despite declines in the density of species, cities still retain endemic native species, thus providing opportunities for regional and global biodiversity conservation, restoration and education.},

It addresses whether teacher characteristics, including verbal ability and race, influenced “synthetic gain scores” of students (mean test scores of upper grade students in a school minus mean test scores of lower grade students in a school), in the context of an econometric model that allows for the possibility that teacher characteristics in a school are endogenously determined. We find that verbal aptitude scores of teachers influenced synthetic grain scores for both black and white students. Verbal aptitude mattered as much for black teachers as it did for white teachers. Finally, holding teacher characteristics other than race constant, in some specifications black teachers were associated with higher gain scores for black high school students, but lower gain scores for white elementary and secondary students. Because these findings are for American schools in the mid-1960s, they do not directly apply to our contemporary experience. However, they do raise issues that should be addressed in discussions of hiring policies in American education.},

	abstract = {Abstract For scientists, and other stakeholders to the biodiversity monitoring systems (including AP-BON), capturing and understanding the status and trends of biodiversity and ecosystem services are a main focus. In the policy/science interface, communicating the complex results in comprehensible ways has been one of the key challenges. Development of indicators, maps and other visualization tools are instrumental for identification, understanding, and to support the relevant policy decisions and processes. In recent years, different cities have explored the development of such indicators in the urban context through negotiation. Development of indicators for urban ecosystems and biodiversity is illustrated. The potential challenge of application and use of such indicator in Japanese urban contexts are reviewed based on interviews and existing data. This article discusses and reviews the advantages and limitations of urban biodiversity indicators. The review focused on applying the newly developed City Biodiversity Index (CBI). It is modifying Singapore city biodiversity index adjusted as Japanese local municipalities can easily and practically use it. The data is based on research project implemented by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, Japan (MLIT). The existing literature points out that the policy makers tend to emphasize ecosystem services for justification of their policies, while scientists tend to focus on biodiversity. Such twists are not a major problem if the status of biodiversity correlates with ecosystem services. This is true at a global or at a regional scale, but may be different at the local level. For example, the results of studies by the city of Nagoya indicate that ecosystem services correlate with the size of green or open spaces and not with the status of biodiversity. As such, applying biodiversity indicators at different scales can be a contentious issue. In addition, the integration of biodiversity relevant elements to ecological footprint maps is often discussed from the perspectives of local governments.},

In parallel variety of habitats were created in urban environments, which may also support species diversity. Our aim was to identify urban green areas and their connections with the Regional Ecological Network surrounding the city of Debrecen (East-Hungary), and to explore the biodiversity potential of the network of these parks. We found that whilst industrial areas, airport and mixed land covered a relatively large area, parks and other functional green spaces had a relatively small extent. However the green space system of the city is well connected to the Regional Ecological Network. We also surveyed the functional and potential green spaces in the city and in the studied patches of the Regional Ecological Network in and around the city. We found that 65\% of the functional green spaces are potentially connected thus there is a possibility for species typical to semi-natural open habitats to disperse between the green spaces of the city. Based on the survey of the spontaneous ﬂora and planted ornamentals we found that the ratio of native species was high in the studied urban parks. We found that native species were the most typical ({\textgreater}50\%) in the spontaneous ﬂora of the studied urban parks, although the ratio of archaeophytes and neophytes were also high. Among ornamental plants, both the proportion of native species and neophytes were considerable in each park, and the proportion of archaeophytes was low. Our results suggest that the studied urban habitats have some biodiversity conservation potential; they mostly harbour species which can cope with the local environmental conditions of the city parks, such as increased temperature, drought and nutrient enrichment.},

	abstract = {Stormwater bioﬁlters are an important part of the urban landscape in many Australian cities. Until recently, plant species have been selected primarily for their survivability and aesthetics. However, recent research has identiﬁed speciﬁc species that enhance bioﬁlter functions such as pollutant removal and ﬂood prevention (via inﬁltration). Prior to these ﬁndings, little attention was paid to developing planting plans that included plant species with speciﬁc functional traits, such as speciﬁc root length (SRL), percent ﬁne roots (PFR), and relative growth rate (RGR); rather, bioﬁlter planting plans often suggest planting a relatively large number of plant species with the expectation that some species will not survive due to competition and environmental factors. As these unsuited species are lost, species diversity might be expected to be lower in older bioﬁlters. However, it is unknown whether biodiversity or functional diversity (i.e., the diversity of functional traits) actually decreases as bioﬁlters age. To investigate this question, we surveyed plant communities in 32 bioﬁlters along a chronosequence in Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney. From these data, we calculated biodiversity and functional diversity indices from trait (i.e., SRL, PFR, and RGR) data available in the literature for dominant plant species. We found that, although plant species diversity is lower in older bioﬁlters, functional diversity is unaﬀected by age. These trends suggest bioﬁlter plant communities maintain functional diversity despite losing biodiversity over time. A better understanding of how plant functional traits relate to ecosystem functions would let us design bioﬁlters with better performance and value.},

Using abundance data from 99 minimally disturbed sites (i.e., no or very weak anthropogenic impact) from a national survey, we studied the spatial variability of compositional and functional biodiversity metrics across a predeﬁned ecoregional classiﬁcation. Metrics of compositional diversity comprised taxonomic and EPT richness and Simpson diversity. Functional diversity metrics were based on Rao’s Quadratic Entropy (RQE), which described the differences among benthic invertebrate genera in eleven biological traits (e.g., size, life cycle, reproduction types, feeding habits). Using generalized linear models we show that taxonomic richness may vary greatly across ecoregions, contrasting with Simpson diversity and functional metrics that varied weakly in response to natural environmental variability. Functional diversity metrics, because of their stability in response to natural environmental variability, may be useful tools for assessing human impairment to ecosystem function. We further tested the response of functional diversity metrics to a speciﬁc human impact (sewage) and demonstrated signiﬁcant modiﬁcations of functional diversity downstream of sewage pollution. Further investigations are required to test the ability of functional diversity metrics to precisely and accurately indicate different types of human impacts.},

However, it is unclear how much published empirical evidence exists to support these assumptions. We conducted a review of studies published between 1990 and May 2017 that examined urban biodiversity ecosystem service (BES) relationships. In total, we reviewed 317 publications and found biodiversity and UES metrics mentioned 944 times. Only 228 (24\%) of the 944 mentions were empirically tested. Among these, 119 (52\%) demonstrated a positive BES relationship. Our review showed that taxonomic metrics were used most often as proxies for biodiversity, with very little attention given to functional biodiversity metrics. Similarly, the role of particular species, including non-natives, and speciﬁc functional traits are understudied. Finally, we found a paucity of empirical evidence underpinning urban BES relationships. As urban planners increasingly incorporate UES delivery consideration to their decision-making, researchers need to address these substantial knowledge gaps to allow potential trade-offs and synergies between biodiversity conservation and the promotion of UES to be adequately accounted for.},

	abstract = {Trees play a key role in neighborhood landscapes, a belief that has been widely held for millennia in areas beyond Sub-Saharan Africa. Unfortunately, awareness of modern landscape architecture was almost absent in Rwanda until the late 20th century. Today, houses with surrounding decorative and amenity plants are a common feature in Rwanda’s neighborhood landscapes and, as the villagization of settlements progresses, new kinds of landscapes are emerging. This paper explores neighborhood tree planting around human settlements in the country. Remote sensing, photogrammetry, photo interpretation, and plant surveys were the core methods used. The average tree cover fraction ranged between 10\%–35\%. As the result of what is hereafter referred to as the “luxury effect,” a discrete gradient was detected along which the diversity of ornamental and amenity trees increases with the socio-economic status of neighborhoods: from rural settlements to urban residences via a series of intermediate designs, in which different levels of human-built vegetated areas alternate with non-landscaped spaces. Showy, non-productive amenity trees tend to occur more in wealthy quarters of the inner core of cities while edible ornamentals and other productive neighborhood trees prevail in rural and spontaneous settlements. In general, the practice of landscape plant design, in spite of its constant improvement, is still striving to get established as a profession in the country.},

Location The Wetterau region north of Frankfurt/Main, Hesse, Germany. Methods The occurrence and abundance of plant species were recorded in 2003 along transects in 66 settlements in a region north of Frankfurt/Main (Germany). The transect routes had been established in an earlier study in 1974–81. We used ordinations to analyse species composition, fitting 10 independent variables to explain the main gradient in species composition. Additionally, socio-economic styles (derived from interviews of 1359 households) were fitted, to analyse the influence of these on plant communities. Finally, we analysed species richness by calculating independent contributions of the variables using hierarchical partitioning. Results Many species of neophytes have expanded their range since the 1974–81 survey, but this was not associated with a general decline of archaeophytes and natives. The main variation of species composition was along a rural to urban gradient, associated with site conditions and with socio-economic factors that vary from settlements dominated by households rooted in the local community to settlements characterized by a mobile new middle class. For neophytes, variables describing the connection to Frankfurt (distance or connectivity) were most important in predicting species richness. For archaeophytes, the data showed a positive relationship between species richness and increasing herbicide application. Main conclusions These results suggest that the occurrence of neophytes within settlements along the urban–rural gradient is triggered by dispersal, related to human mobility patterns. In contrast, the occurrence of archaeophytes in settlements is determined by disturbance-related factors that predominantly depend on traditional gardening practices and weed control practices associated with farming.},

All vascular plant species were recorded following a grid-map of 1km2-cells totally or partly covered by the forest. A total of 414 plant species was observed. Species composition and plant functional groups in forest edges and the neighbouring forest interior are studied. The study quantifies plant functional groups (e.g. ancient forest plants, true forest species, rare species, geophytes, C, S or R-strategists) in the plots and tests for relationships with the geographical position in the forest according to a city-to-forest gradient. Our results led us to identify distinct characteristics of forest flora based on the distance to the actual city border. The study revealed significant outer edge effects on the flora. Plant composition of the forest interior and forest edge can be separated by ordination on species composition, suggesting that these two biotopes have a distinct species assemblage. χ2-test and Two-Way-Indicator-Species-Analysis detected significant edge-associated species that were recorded exclusively in the edge or were the most frequent in the forest edge. We found that forest stands close to urban areas support populations of indicators of disturbance (pioneer species, C and R-strategists and aliens) to plots which are distant from the city. However, our observations also suggest that species groups with high conservation value (e.g. ancient forest species, or rare species) may also be more represented at the edge than in the core of the forest. Moreover, no forest specialists which would occur only in the interior zone were found. These observations are in disagreement with the hypothesis that true forest plants and species groups of high conservation value would be more frequent in the forest than on the borders. These findings are applicable to the management of forests in an urban context.},

The gradient included six sites of increasingly urban land-use: a preserve, a recreational area, a golf course, a residential subdivision, apartment complexes, and a business district. We recorded species identity and stem diameter for all woody plants greater than 3 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) to examine the distribution of individual species as well as overall community composition. We used digitized aerial photographs to compare the spatial characteristics of the forest canopy at each site. We found predictable patterns in species diversity (Shannon index), spatial heterogeneity in species composition (mean percent dissimilarity), and all measures of patch fragmentation (canopy cover and patch number and size). There were clear differences in tree density and total basal area between forested sites and developed sites, but there was little resolution among developed sites. Species richness and average DBH showed no clear pattern, suggesting that landscaping preference largely determined these values. We present a modified version of an intermediate heterogeneity model that can be used to predict diversity patterns in urban areas. We discuss probable mechanisms that led to these patterns and the potential implications for animal communities in urban environments.},

	abstract = {The validation of plant functional type models across contrasting landscapes is seen as a step towards the claim that plant functional types should recur regionally or even globally. I sampled the vegetation of an urban landscape on a range of sites representing gradients of resource supply and disturbance intensity. A group of plants with similar attributes was considered a 'functional type', if the species significantly co-occurred in a certain segment of the gradient plane of resource supply and disturbance intensity. Vegetative and regeneration traits were considered. A similar study was performed in a nearby agricultural landscape (Kleyer 1999). The logistic regression models from the urban landscape were applied to the data set of the agricultural landscape and vice versa. Although the overall environment of the two landscapes was very different, recurrent patterns of several functional types were found. At high fertility and high disturbance levels, annual species predominated with a persistent seed bank, high seed output, and short vertical expansion. When disturbances changed from below-ground to above-ground, the sexual regeneration mode was replaced by the vegetative mode, while vertical expansion remained low. At medium disturbance intensities, the vertical expansion and vegetative regeneration increased with fertility, while the seed bank remained mostly transient to short-term persistent and lateral expansion and sexual regeneration was intermediate. At low disturbances and low resource supplies, seed bank longevity, and vertical and lateral expansion tended to be long. Diversity of groups of plants with similar attributes was highest at intermediate disturbance levels and low fertility. These results correspond with Grime's humped-back model and Connell's intermediate disturbance hypothesis.},

As part of a larger survey of biodiversity in gardens in Sheffield, UK, we examined the composition and diversity of the flora in two 1-m2 quadrats in each of 60 gardens, and compared this with floristic data from semi-natural habitats in central England and derelict urban land in Birmingham, UK. Garden quadrats contained more than twice as many taxa as those from any other habitat type. Ca. 33 \% of garden plants were natives and 67 \% aliens, mainly from Europe and Asia. A higher proportion of garden aliens originated from Asia and New Zealand than in the UK alien flora as a whole; 18 of the 20 most frequent plants in garden quadrats were natives, mostly common weeds. Garden quadrats showed no evidence of ‘nestedness’, i.e. a tendency for scarce species to be confined to the highest diversity quadrats. Conversely, species in all semi-natural and derelict land data sets were significantly nested. Compared to a range of semi-natural habitats, species richness of garden quadrats was intermediate, and strikingly similar to the richness of derelict land quadrats. Although species accumulation curves for all other habitats showed signs of saturation at 120 quadrats, gardens did not. Correlations between Sørensen similarity index and physical distance were insignificant for all habitat types, i.e. there was little evidence that physical distance played any part in structuring the composition of the quadrats in any of the data sets. However, garden quadrats were much less similar to each other than quadrats from semi-natural habitats or derelict land.},

	abstract = {When measured by extent and intensity, urbanization is one of the most homogenizing of all major human activities. Cities homogenize the physical environment because they are built to meet the relatively narrow needs of just one species, our own. Also, cities are maintained for centuries in a disequilibrium state from the local natural environment by the importation of vast resources of energy and materials. Consequently, as cities expand across the planet, biological homogenization increases because the same “urban-adaptable” species become increasingly widespread and locally abundant in cities across the planet. As urbanization often produces a local gradient of disturbance, one can also observe a gradient of homogenization. Synanthropic species adapted to intensely modified built habitats at the urban core are “global homogenizers”, found in cities worldwide. However, many suburban and urban fringe habitats are occupied by native species that become regionally widespread. These suburban adapters typically consist of early successional plants and “edge” animal species such as mesopredator mammals, and ground-foraging, omnivorous and frugivorous birds that can utilize gardens, forest fragments and many other habitats available in the suburbs. A basic conservation challenge is that urban biota is often quite diverse and very abundant. The intentional and unintentional importation of species adapted to urban habitats, combined with many food resources imported for human use, often produces local species diversity and abundance that is often equal to or greater than the surrounding landscape. With the important exception of low-income areas, urban human populations often inhabit richly cultivated suburban habitats with a relatively high local floral and faunal diversity and/or abundance without awareness of the global impoverishment caused by urbanization. Equally challenging is that, because so many urban species are immigrants adapting to city habitats, urbanites of all income levels become increasingly disconnected from local indigenous species and their natural ecosystems. Urban conservation should therefore focus on promoting preservation and restoration of local indigenous species.},

A detailed vascular flora of the City was published elsewhere. This paper updates the flora with information from an important and previously overlooked collection of specimens, and examines the apparent historic losses of native species in relation to habitat and taxonomy. Overall species losses were about 18\% in the past century. Losses were particularly high among species associated with aquatic habitats, bogs, and calcareous or circumneutral terrestrial habitats. I suggest that the first of these reflects extensive alteration of many bodies of water through siltation, chemical pollution, eutrophication, and stream channelization. Losses in the remaining two habitat types may reflect the initial rarity of such habitats within the City combined with habitat destruction. Losses were especially high in several families, including the Orchidaceae, Ophioglossaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Menyanthaceae, Lentibulariaceae, and Lamiaceae. High losses of aquatic and bog species have been noted in other areas, and high losses among orchids appear to be nearly universal. A combination of changing land use, habitat fragmentation, successional changes, species introductions, and climate changes are likely to cause further species losses in the decades ahead.},

	title = {Biological {Diversity} in {Urban} {Environments}},
	abstract = {The thesis approaches the concept of urban biodiversity from different angles in an attempt to explain its significance. In a study from the constructed Toftanäs wetland park, methods of affecting local biodiversity are demonstrated as integrated with other functions, such as water quality and stormwater detention. Vegetation analyses are provided to show the rapid and sometimes unexpected change in species composition. Both spontaneous and introduced species were followed in a five-year project. Theoretical aspects of urban biodiversity are studied in-depth and the different views on biodiversity in general and urban biodiversity in particular are scrutinised. It is concluded that a holistic view on urban biodiversity probably reflects the true conditions best. In a method study, a few different kinds of biodiversity mapping were tested. It was concluded that the biotope-mapping model tested was easy and rapid, but incomplete. Patch mapping was more time-consuming, but possibly more informative. Patch shape was compared to species diversity, but there was no correlation. It was concluded that both kinds of mapping need to be calibrated with biological data, and that the human function of urban environments should be an integrated part of urban biodiversity studies. A method of assessing the perception of biodiversity was tested using a semantic test onsite. An index for biodiversity experience was created and later tested also in a photo-based study. Both studies comprised laymen as well as experts. It was concluded that there were differences between photo-based and on-site ratings, but the biggest difference was detected with the on-site experts. As a general conclusion of the thesis it can be stated that urban biodiversity is an integral part of the urban environment, and that it is impossible to regard the city without its biological component, as well as it is impossible to regard the biological component without its human connection.},

Each town has different socioeconomic status. Therefore, the present study investigates 1) the patterns and differences in the diversity and density of street tree communities across the towns of different socio-economic status, 2) the patterns and differences in the diversity and density of the communities of different road widths, 3) the factors that cause variation in different attributes of the community. The study revealed significant variation in the diversity and density of the tree community of different towns and road categories. The socioeconomic status of towns and different road categories demonstrated statistically significant influence in determining their tree density and species diversity. Statistically significant correlation was found between socioeconomic status and tree density per thousand inhabitants of towns. The study divulges recurring planting of one or few species that decrease the species diversity in many towns and streets. Conocarpus erectus revealed strong dominance on wide and medium width roads while it demonstrated co-dominance with Azadirachta indica on narrow roads. Overall, 62 species (30 native and 32 exotic) were recorded, which were very unevenly distributed in the streetscape of the city. The study also discusses the socioeconomic factors and role of civic agencies in planting trees.},

PC2 was positively correlated with the percentage of residential area around a stand, while PC3 showed negative correlation with the abundance of phanerophytes in the herb-layer. These correlation analyses and the scores for PC2 and PC3 of respective species suggested that PC2 should be identified with the change due to urbanization and PC3 with the intensity of human disturbance.

We found strong evidence linking biodiversity with production of ecosystem services and between nature exposure and human health, but many of these studies were limited in rigor and often only correlative. Much less information is available to link biodiversity and health. However, some robust studies indicate that exposure to microbial biodiversity can improve health, specifically in reducing certain allergic and respiratory diseases. Overall, much more research is needed on mechanisms of causation. Also needed are a re-envisioning of land-use planning that places human well-being at the center and a new coalition of ecologists, health and social scientists and planners to conduct research and develop policies that promote human interaction with nature and biodiversity.

            Urban trees are instrumental in providing ecosystem services to urban society. However, they are subject to many pressures linked to harsh site conditions created by the urban environment, climate change, attack by pests and diseases and the political and social influences that control how urban trees are perceived and managed. An ongoing provision of services from all trees within an urban area (known as the urban forest) can only be achieved through high resilience to these pressures. This study aims to examine the current state of composition, condition and structure of 12 urban forests across Great Britain, by reviewing data collected from i-Tree Eco city or town-wide surveys and recommending a framework to rate their sustainability. The study shows that urban forests are hardy to local winter temperatures and in good health, but lack in large size trees and tree species diversity. Also, several urban forests offer small percentage canopy cover. The wider application of this framework and the creation of detailed tree strategies could help local authorities to establish management strategies, set goals and monitor progress towards achieving greater sustainability.},

Various field and Geographic Information System (GIS) tests were performed to help understand how time costs and precision of tree population estimates change with varying plot and sample sizes in urban areas using random sampling approaches. Using one-tenth acre (0.04 ha) plots, it is estimated that, on average, approximately three plots per day can be measured with plot data collected on several variables for all trees greater than 1 in (2.54 cm) in diameter along with general plot, ground cover, and shrub data. A field crew of two people can gather approximately 200 one-tenth acre (0.04 ha) plots during a 14 week summer field season depending on city traffic, city area, and tree cover conditions.

	abstract = {Understanding the difference of greenspace in different urban areas is a critical requirement for maintaining urban natural environment and lessening environmental inequality. However, how urban expansion impacts on people’s exposure to ambient green environments has been limitedly addressed. Here we integrated multi-source geospatial big data including mobile-phone location-based service (LBS) data, Sentinel-2, and nighttime light satellite imageries to quantitatively estimate changes in people’s exposure to green environments for 290 cities in China from 1992 to 2015. Results showed that the urban expansion process directly led to differences in green environments between old and new urban areas. These differences were not only observed by the green coverage rate but also captured using a dynamic assessment of people’s exposure to greenspace. For most of China’s large cities, people could enjoy more greenspace in new urban areas than the old ones. A significant day-to-night variation of people’s exposure to greenspace was identified between old and new urban areas. Our results also revealed that urbanization did bring some positive effects to improve green environments for cities located in harsh natural conditions (e.g., semiarid/arid and desert regions).},

	abstract = {Urban trees composition and diversity are gaining more relevance for academic, urban planning and sustainability purposes. Despite their free ecosystem services, little is documented on urban trees especially in developing countries such as Nigeria. This study assessed the composition, diversity, structural characteristics and provenance of trees in two cities of North-western Nigeria. Landsat images for 2015 were used to classify each city into five broad land cover classes to facilitate stratified sampling. Data on tree species, height, Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) and provenance was collected from a total of 373 plots of 30 × 30 m dimension. A total of 1558 trees belonging to 56 species in 46 genera and 22 families were assessed with generally more categories of native than exotic species but higher populations of exotic stems. Azadirachta indica and Mangifera indica were the most dominant species in both cities while Meliaceae, Anacardiaceae, Fabaceae, Moraceae and Combretaceae were the dominant families. Lower diversity (H’ = 1.8), lower evenness (J = 0.53) and lower mean density (42.4 trees/ha) were recorded in Sokoto compared to Zaria (H’ = 3.30, J = 0.84 and density = 50.48 trees/ha). A one-way ANOVA revealed significant difference in these parameters across the land cover types within the cities except mean height which was not significantly different in Sokoto. An independent samples t-test also revealed significantly different mean height, diameter and Basal Area (BA) but similar plot densities between the cities. Urban tree composition, diversity and structural characteristics vary significantly between these two cities in North-western Nigeria and though exotic species have fewer categories, their stems are gradually dominating the cities. This may cause alterations in tree species composition and diversity and possibly, biotic homogenization. This calls for expanded tree planting with more emphasis on the native species.},

In this study, we analysed the impacts of urbanization and agricultural legacy on plant communities of isolated wetlands (Laval, Québec, Canada). We sampled 35 marshes and 32 swamps. We used multi-factor analysis of variance to compare taxonomic richness and functional diversity between wetland types, urbanization levels and former agricultural use. We calculated beta diversity as between-site similarities in composition, and differences were evaluated using tests for homogeneity in multivariate dispersions. We also analysed the effect of exotic species on beta diversity. We found that urbanization and former agricultural use had no effect on taxonomic richness, functional diversity or beta diversity. However, exotics tended to be more abundant in urban and previously cultivated wetlands than in more natural ones. Furthermore, despite the absence of difference in beta diversity in response to present and past human disturbances when analysing the total species pool, we found that exotic species tend to favor homogenization. We also found that species composition differed in response to urbanization in marshes, while in swamps it differed according to former agricultural uses. This contrasting result was likely due to the fact that marshes are dominated by herbaceous species and swamps by woody species (short vs. long regeneration time). Our study highlights the importance of looking at different types of habitats within the same urban context and considering land use legacy to understand the response of ecosystems to urbanization, especially due to the time lag between disturbances and vegetation responses.},

In this paper, we used a new approach to improve the potential of urban trees in optimizing more desirable environmental benefits. This was done by selecting the most appropriate tree species among a vast range of species based on their potential environmental function (both services and disservices) in Tabriz city, Iran. Also, three main planting scenarios (divided to six sub-scenarios) were developed so as to understand the long-term effectiveness of introducing the selected tree species in improving the environmental benefits (both urban forest structure and ES) in comparison with planting the existing tree species. The results indicate that regardless of the quantity of planting, the benefits of introducing the selected trees will be more than planting the existing species. Moreover, as the amount of the annual planting of the recommended species increases, so does the improvement in the projected tree characteristics and ES. This approach creates more opportunities which enable urban forest managers and policymakers to understand the importance of selecting the proper urban tree species when looking for a nature-based solution to promote the wellbeing of the urban population, to create more livable and ecologically sustainable cities and to mitigate urban environmental problems., Article highlights Setting out a new approach to select the proper urban tree species by integrating the species potential environmental functions (ecosystem services and disservices) We analyzed the effectiveness of introducing the recommend species on the upcoming amount of multiple ES and disservices and also tree traits through scenario developing Introducing tree species with high potential in generating ES into urban context can lead to significant improvement both in structural traits of urban tree and environmental benefits. As the relative frequency of the recommended species increase, the provision of ES and also structural characteristics of trees improve. Our approach creates opportunities for considering the importance of planting appropriate species in urban green infrastructure policymaking and also integrate ES concept in urban planning strategies.},

	abstract = {Research on urban forests has expanded in the last 30 years in the US, Canada, Europe, and Australia. Nonetheless, urban forestry has been explored to much less extent in Latin America and the Caribbean region, despite it being one of the most urbanized and biodiverse regions in the world. We address this gap by providing a baseline understanding of urban forest research based on a systematic review of the academic literature from the region. Of the 55,000 studies found in searches, 195 were selected for review, and 182 were analysed and synthesized. These studies came from 13 countries and were published from 1970 to mid-2018 (inclusive) in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Almost half of the studies were based in Brazil, followed by Mexico and Chile. To assess article output by country in a comparable way, we accounted for a country’s population, and Brazil, Chile, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico had higher than average article output per capita. Most articles were ecological studies (64\%) that used field surveys (58\%) to research urban vegetation diversity. Most ecological studies did not include any social or management considerations. Only few studies focused on spatiotemporal dynamics (12\%) or the direct opinion of stakeholders (9\%). We observed a sharp increase in article output from the region during the last decade. The units of analysis targeted by these studies were diverse, but most studies focused on single trees in public areas (streets and parks). Understanding urban forests regionally could be strengthened by scaling up research across multiple units of analysis and across cities from the region. Comparison among cities could provide a better understanding of: urban forest spatiotemporal dynamics regionally. To respond to current global trends and nurture regional strengths, regional research could also focus on a wider range of ecosystem services provided by urban forests, and the relationship of urban forests with poverty, crime, climate vulnerability, biodiversity loss, and social equity. These findings can inform key stakeholders in the region managing urban forests and trees about research trends and gaps to be filled.},

          Degradation and loss of natural habitat is the major driver of the current global biodiversity crisis. Most habitat conservation efforts to date have targeted small areas of highly threatened habitat, but emerging debate suggests retaining large intact natural systems may be just as important. We reconcile these perspectives by integrating fine-resolution global data on habitat condition and species assemblage turnover, to identify Earth’s high-value biodiversity habitat. These are areas in better condition than most other locations once supporting a similar assemblage of species, and are found within both intact regions and human dominated landscapes. However, only 18.6 \% of this high-value habitat is currently protected globally. Averting permanent biodiversity loss requires clear spatially explicit targets for retaining these unprotected high-value habitats.},

	abstract = {Worldwide, various tree species have been worshiped and praised because they are culturally significant in many nations. To address the questions of whether and how the preference for cultural trees influences the plant diversity in urban ecosystems characterized by human-created vegetation, we surveyed the plant composition in 239 designed landscape units (DLUs). We compared the tree diversity in the DLUs with that in all public green spaces, including both natural remnants and cultivated vegetation, in the built-up area of Nanjing city, China. We found that the species richness proportion of native species decreased from 58.01 \% (192/311) in all public spaces to 39.71 \% (81/204) in the DLUs, largely due to the low species resource utilization ratio of native noncultural species, which accounted for 75 \% of all native tree species. In detail, 77.08 \% (37/48 species) of native cultural species and all introduced cultural species (57/57) were recorded in the DLUs; however, only 30.56 \% (44/144 species) of native noncultural and 80.49 \% (66/82) of introduced noncultural species in all public spaces were recorded in the DLUs. For the native trees that were recorded in the DLUs, the total frequency, total abundance, median abundance and median frequency of native noncultural species were much lower than those of the native cultural tree species, although the species richness of noncultural trees (44 species) was higher than that of cultural trees (37 species). Furthermore, the relative richness and abundance per DLU of native noncultural tree species were significantly lower than those of native cultural tree species (p {\textless} 0.05). The results indicated that the preference for cultural trees contributed to the low diversity of native trees in the DLUs. We suggest that the difference between ‘national’ plants in the cultural sense and ‘native’ plants in terms of their natural distributions should be discerned, especially in regions with unified cultures. Promoting regional cultural diversity and accepting the value of ‘localized tree species’ can help us coordinate the cultural value and native biodiversity value of landscaping trees in urban greening.},

Given the diverse locations in which trees currently exist within cities, including public and private property, gardens, parks, and abandoned lots, we discuss the overlooked contribution of cemeteries to the urban forest. Specifically, we discuss the potential to expand the urban forest through planting trees in the cemeteries of Halifax, Nova Scotia (Canada). The objectives of our research were to 1) characterize the existing tree populations in Halifax cemeteries, and 2) estimate how many trees could be planted within these cemeteries. Our research indicates that Halifax cemeteries are dominated by non-native species such as Acer platanoides, Tilia cordata, and Ulmus glabra. Smaller trees are mostly limited to small copses comprised of dense regenerating stock, while the majority of area within cemeteries contains only larger and older trees. Limited natural regeneration and planting efforts, combined with the large size of Halifax’s cemetery trees, indicates the likelihood of future canopy losses. However, this study also found over 2000 spots in which trees could be planted in the 27.5 ha of Halifax cemeteries, indicating that their tree populations could be almost doubled. Barriers such as financial limitations and hesitancy to plant trees amongst monuments need to be addressed and consideration needs to be given to the relationship between cemetery users and trees to determine how best to maintain (and potentially expand) the urban forest within cemeteries.},

	abstract = {The extent and continued expansion of urbanisation has focused attention on the significance for native biodiversity of those green spaces remaining within such areas and the most appropriate methods of managing them. In the UK, a high proportion of urban space is comprised of the private or domestic gardens associated with residential dwellings, and many recommendations have been made for simple changes to improve their value for biodiversity (‘wildlife gardening’). Here, we report the results of replicated experimental tests of five such common recommendations, involving the introduction to gardens of (i) artificial nest sites for solitary bees and wasps; (ii) artificial nest sites for bumblebees; (iii) small ponds; (iv) dead wood for fungi and other saproxylic organisms; and (v) patches of nettles Urtica dioica L. for butterfly larvae. The broad conclusion is that whilst some methods for increasing the biodiversity of garden environments may be very effective, others have a low probability of success on the timescales and spatial scales likely to be acceptable to many garden owners. If one of the functions of small scale biodiversity enhancement is to develop and encourage awareness of biodiversity and its conservation, then encouragement to conduct particular activities must be balanced with a realistic appraisal of their likely success.},

	abstract = {Research Highlights: A large body of research highlighted the important contributions that urban forests make to cities and their inhabitants. However, our urban forests face threats from issues such as rapid urbanization, climate change, and the spread of pests and diseases. As such, proactive and effective management is necessary to ensure their long-term sustainability. Given the multiple spatial and temporal scales on which threats can arise, effective management needs to account for these scales and adjust accordingly. The degree to which this currently happens is unclear. Background and Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the role of multi-scale management in urban forestry, using cemeteries in Malm\&ouml;, Sweden as a case study. Cemeteries can provide extensive tree canopy but are not readily considered in urban forest management. We sought to determine (1) the threats to the current cemetery tree populations, (2) the extent of multi-scale cemetery tree management, (3) whether tree management plans promote multi-scale management, and (4) how cemetery tree management can be improved. Materials and Methods: Malm\&ouml; cemetery tree inventories were analyzed with respect to size class and species diversity. Existing cemetery tree management plans were examined to determine the spatial and temporal scales of their recommendations. Interviews were conducted with cemetery managers to determine management priorities and actions. Results: We found that cemetery tree populations in Malm\&ouml; suffer from a lack of age class and species diversity. Management tends to occur on short time scales and efforts focus mainly on addressing individual trees, although some consideration is given to large-scale species diversification. The management plans previously created for these cemetery trees make recommendations for age class and species diversification but are yet to be used extensively by cemetery managers. Conclusions: The long-term stability of Malm\&ouml;\&rsquo;s cemetery tree populations is threatened by a lack of species and age diversity. Current management efforts emphasize addressing small-scale issues. Although there is a desire to improve species diversity, this can cause conflict with existing cultural values.},

	abstract = {Seventy-five percent of the human population will live in urban areas by 2050, and urban vegetation will be the main source of ecosystem services. Unequal access to urban vegetation might exacerbate existing socioeconomic differences. Studies performed in cities of developed countries show that the population with higher socioeconomic status has more access to ecosystem services provided by vegetation. In urban areas, with small internal climatic variation, plant productivity measured through satellite imagery is a good indicator of vegetation availability that can be mapped. In this study, we characterized the distribution of plant productivity in 40 Argentine urban centers and we identified socio-environmental variables that control its spatial patterns within and among urban centers. We used socioeconomic indicators obtained from the 2010 National Population and Households Census and a 4-year mean plant productivity measured through the integration of NDVI values derived from MODIS satellite images. In most of the analyzed cities, plant productivity increased as socioeconomic status decreased; and only in 25\% of the cities, we found a positive relationship between socioeconomic status and plant productivity. In the latter case, most of the cities were placed in arid environments, where both the cost of watering and the effect of subsidized water on plant productivity are proportionally higher. Buenos Aires and Bariloche, which also showed positive associations between socioeconomic status and plant productivity, are located in humid environments, but Buenos Aires is the most densely populated city of Argentina and Bariloche is a touristic city; in these cities, the relative cost of keeping green spaces instead of building housing infrastructure is also high. These results show that vegetation distribution among socioeconomic status is more diverse than suggested by the literature and that the appropriation of vegetation productivity by groups with higher socioeconomic status only occurs when vegetation cost increases to the point of becoming a luxury good.},

	abstract = {Urban vegetation provides many ecosystem services that make cities more liveable for people. As the world continues to urbanise, the vegetation cover in urban areas is changing rapidly. Here we use Google Earth Engine to map vegetation cover in all urban areas larger than 15 km2 in 2000 and 2015, which covered 390,000 km2 and 490,000 km2 respectively. In 2015, urban vegetation covered a substantial area, equivalent to the size of Belarus. Proportional vegetation cover was highly variable, and declined in most urban areas between 2000 and 2015. Declines in proportional vegetated cover were particularly common in the Global South. Conversely, proportional vegetation cover increased in some urban areas in eastern North America and parts of Europe. Most urban areas that increased in vegetation cover also increased in size, suggesting that the observed net increases were driven by the capture of rural ecosystems through low-density suburban sprawl. Far fewer urban areas achieved increases in vegetation cover while remaining similar in size, although this trend occurred in some regions with shrinking populations or economies. Maintaining and expanding urban vegetation cover alongside future urbanisation will be critical for the well-being of the ﬁve billion people expected to live in urban areas by 2030.},

	abstract = {Studies have demonstrated a relationship between plant species diversity within urban green spaces (UGS) and psychological restoration of visitors. However, the majority of “non ecologist” visitors are not able to perceive all the different plant species present within UGS. More work is thus needed to explore and better understand the underlying processes of this relationship. Recent studies have suggested that “non ecologist” visitors are able to perceive landscape heterogeneity within UGS, which is related to species diversity based on landscape ecology theories. The goal of this study was to test whether landscape heterogeneity can begin to elucidate the relationship between species diversity within UGS and psychological restoration of visitors. Within 13 UGS in Rennes (France) we tested if relationships can be established between i) measured landscape heterogeneity, ii) landscape heterogeneity perceived by visitors, and iii) psychological restoration of visitors. We measured landscape heterogeneity using different landscape-level metrics, and quantified psychological restoration and perception of landscape heterogeneity of 390 visitors using in situ questionnaires. Our results evidenced that within UGS visitors are able to perceive landscape compositional and configurational heterogeneity, and that they gain psychological restoration from landscape configurational heterogeneity. We advise that enhancing landscape configurational heterogeneity within UGS could help designers and managers increase both their environmental and social benefits.},

	abstract = {Pests, disease, and climate change pose major challenges to street tree survival, and diversity in tree species and genera is widely considered to promote the sustainability of municipal street tree populations. Conversely, the lack of sufficient diversity in street tree population was judged a contributing factor in the death and removal of thousands of street trees in Worcester, Massachusetts, that state’s second most populous city, due to an infestation of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB, Anoplophora glabripennis). Therefore, reducing the dominance of prevalent street tree species and genera and increasing tree species and genera diversity are considered vital to sustainable street tree management and to the preservation of the ecosystem services and social benefits that street trees provide. This paper assesses street tree diversity in Massachusetts by analyzing a nonrandom sample of collated municipal street tree inventory data stratified by plant hardiness zones. Consistent with results previously found for Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, results in Massachusetts indicate that a relatively small number of species and genera dominate the composition of most municipal street tree populations, including in particular Acer spp. (maple), one of the ALB’s favorite host genera. There is accordingly a need for greater species and genus diversity in municipal street tree populations statewide. While there may be a trend towards increased street tree diversity and reduction in the dominance of Acer spp., considerable work remains to be done.},

In this study, we evaluated the performance of simple random sampling (SRS), stratified random sampling (STR), systematic sampling (SS), and generalized random-tessellation stratified sampling (GRTS) for obtaining information on urban forests in Philadelphia, United States and Beijing, China. We determined the spatial locations of all urban trees in the two cities from high-resolution aerial images. We ran simulated surveys on the data set using the four sampling designs with varied sample sizes to estimate structural variables of urban forests, including the total number of trees, species richness, and species abundance. We conducted accuracy assessments by comparing the estimates to the real values. In the end, we located 1,381,903 and 2,295,794 urban trees in Philadelphia and Beijing, respectively. The results of simulated surveys showed that SRS had a more stable performance than other sampling designs when used for estimating the total number of trees. STR and GRTS performed better than SRS and SS in estimating species richness and detecting rare species. For estimating species abundance, SRS again displayed a stable performance among all designs. Also, we found that small sample sizes (≤200) used in existing studies would lead to estimates of urban forest structure with low accuracy. Our findings provide useful guidance to researchers and practitioners on sampling urban forests.},

Trunk diameter at breast height (DBH) is amongst the most common measures of tree structure due to its ease of measurement and strong relationships with other structural and non-structural urban forest characteristics. Materials and Methods: In this study, the DBH distributions of urban forests are summarised for 38 American cities with a combined population of over 30 million people and a range of geographic, climatic, and demographic conditions. The Anderson\&ndash;Darling (AD) test was used to test the hypothesis that all DBH distributions came from a common population. Moreover, structural diversity was compared using the Shannon\&ndash;Wiener index. Results: The AD test results failed to identify any statistically significant differences in DBH distributions. However, qualitatively, the DBH distributions have two primary forms, which have important functional, management, and planning implications. The vast majority of cities have an exponentially inverse-proportional distribution, such that the proportion of trees in each successively larger DBH class decreases exponentially. The Shannon\&ndash;Wiener index indicates an uneven DBH distribution in the cities with an exponentially inverse-proportional diameter distribution; these cities are dominated by trees in the smallest diameter class. Potential explanations for a large proportion of trees in the smallest diameter classes include a large number of small, naturally regenerating trees; a preference for smaller trees in urban areas; or a recent increase in tree planting efforts. Conclusions: Despite no statistical differences in DBH distributions for the 38 study cities, the functional, management, and planning implications will differ considerably.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Geo-referenced species occurrences from public databases have become essential to biodiversity research and conservation. However, geographical biases are widely recognized as a factor limiting the usefulness of such data for understanding species diversity and distribution. In particular, differences in sampling intensity across a landscape due to differences in human accessibility are ubiquitous but may differ in strength among taxonomic groups and datasets. Although several factors have been described to influence human access (such as presence of roads, rivers, airports and cities), quantifying their specific and combined effects on recorded occurrence data remains challenging. Here we present
            sampbias
            , an algorithm and software for quantifying the effect of accessibility biases in species occurrence datasets.
            Sampbias
            uses a Bayesian approach to estimate how sampling rates vary as a function of proximity to one or multiple bias factors. The results are comparable among bias factors and datasets. We demonstrate the use of
            sampbias
            on a dataset of mammal occurrences from the island of Borneo, showing a high biasing effect of cities and a moderate effect of roads and airports.
            Sampbias
            is implemented as a well-documented, open-access and user-friendly R package that we hope will become a standard tool for anyone working with species occurrences in ecology, evolution, conservation and related fields.},

However, how plant species distribute along the urban\&ndash;rural gradient and what the relationship between urbanization degree and plant diversity is, is not very clear. In this paper, 134 sample sites along two 18 km width transects that run across the urban center of Shanghai were investigated. We quantified the spatial patterns of plant diversity along the urban\&ndash;rural gradient and measured the relationship between plant diversity and urbanization degree, which was calculated using a land use land cover map derived from high spatial resolution aerial photos. We recorded 526 vascular plant species in 134 plots, 57.8\% of which are exotic plant species. Six spatial distribution patterns of species richness were identified for different plant taxa along the rural to urban gradient. The native plant species richness showed no significant relationship to urbanization degree. The richness of the all plants, woody plants and perennial herbs presented significant positive relationship with urbanization degree, while the richness of annual herbs, Shannon-Wiener diversity and Heip evenness all exhibited a negative relationship to urbanization degree. Urbanization could significantly influence plant diversity in Shanghai. Our findings can provide insights to understand the mechanism of urbanization effects on plant diversity, as well as plant diversity conservation in urban areas.},

As multispecific collections of organisms possess numerous statistical properties which conform to the conventional criteria for diversity indices, such collections are not intrinsically arrangeable in linear order along some diversity scale. Several such properties or 'species composition parameters' having straightforward biological interpretations are presented as alternatives to the diversity approach.

The diversity of small collections, all of whose members can be identified and counted, is defined by Brillouin's measure of information. With larger collections it becomes necessary to estimate diversity; what is estimated is Shannon's measure of information which is a function of the population proportions of the several species. Different methods of estimation are appropriate for different types of collections. If the collection can be randomly sampled and the total number of species is known, Basharin's formula may be used. With a random sample from a population containing an unknown number of species, Good's method is sometimes applicable. With a patchy population of sessile organisms, such as a plant community, random samples are unobtainable since the contents of a randomly placed quadrat are not a random sample of the parent population. To estimate the diversity of such a community a method is proposed whereby the sample size is progressively increased by addition of new quadrats; as this is done the diversity of the pooled sample increases and then levels off. The mean increment in total diversity that results from enlarging the sample still more then provides an estimate of the diversity per individual in the whole population.},

The resulting diversity values were highly correlated with the physical stability and past history of these environments. A stability-time hypothesis was invoked to fit these findings, and, with this hypothesis, predictions were made about the diversities present in certain other environments as yet unstudied. The two types of diversity, based on numerical percentage composition and on number of species, were compared and shown to be poorly correlated with each other. Our data indicated that species number is the more valid diversity measurement. The rarefaction methodology was compared with a number of diversity indexes using identical data. Many of these indexes were markedly influenced by sample size. Good agreement was found between the rarefaction methodology and the Shannon-Wiener information function.},

	abstract = {The effects of urbanization on plant diversity have been increasingly investigated around the world, but our knowledge of the performances of urbanized landscape is still inadequate for suitable urban landscape planning and management. We asked: 1) what are the effects of urbanized landscape pattern on indigenous plant diversity, and 2) do these effects exhibit scale dependence? A total of 105 plots, distributed throughout the study area were chosen. Each plot was 10 m × 10 m. Alpha-diversity, and beta-diversity of species taxonomic composition across plots was calculated. Four groups of landscape metrics (complexity, fragmentation, diversity, and urbanization intensity) were measured for each plot. Ten scales, ranging from 100 m to 1000 m and with increasing steps of 100 m, were used as spatial scales. Pearson’s correlation analyses were used to detect relationships between the indigenous plant diversity along the urbanization gradient and the ten landscape metrics. Shannon’s Diversity Index (SDI), Shannon’s Evenness Index (SEI), Edge Density (ED), and Landscape Shape Index (LSI) were highly and positively correlated with alpha and beta plant diversity, whereas Largest Patch Index (LPI) were negatively correlated with plant diversity. Such correlations became stronger at higher spatial scales, and the highest at 600–700 m. The intensity of urbanization increased the values of ED and LPI in urbanized landscape and negatively influenced plant diversity. The correlations were influenced by the spatial extent. The study offers some guidelines on landscape pattern, including patch size, shape, and its configuration, in managing urban areas optimally to support plant diversity and wildlife. Landscape unit with diverse land uses with a radius of 600–700 m for Beijing, and other specific radius for other cities in the world are proposed as the most suitable landscape pattern for preserving indigenous plant diversity.},

	abstract = {While we know that urban vegetation is often distributed unequally, most studies have been undertaken in cities with relatively high levels of income inequality, using a single measure of distribution (usually tree cover) and in a single land use. This study explores predictors of both tree cover and species richness in gardens, streetscapes and parks in Ballarat, Australia. Spatial regression models found that education level was a more important predictor of tree cover than household income across all land uses in Ballarat which can be explained by some people with high incomes relative to education level choosing to live in new residential developments with disproportionately low levels of tree cover. Inequality in tree cover was greater in streetscapes than in residential gardens, suggesting that ‘top down’ political factors are more important than individual behaviours in determining tree cover in Ballarat. In contrast, physical rather than socioeconomic factors were better predictors of species richness across all land uses, highlighting that different measures of vegetation distribution are not necessarily correlated.},

	abstract = {Declining urban tree canopy cover in the United States underscores the importance of elucidating factors that influence the distribution of urban trees. This is particularly relevant as most urban trees are located on private property while their canopies maintain ecosystem services that constitute public goods. Thus, municipalities establish institutions in the form of canopy cover goals and various policies to incentivize private actions to meet those goals. However, urban land use, as governed by municipal zoning policies, plays a role in the abundance, distribution, and potential future location of urban trees independent of policies meant specifically to manage canopy. For instance, previous research finds that lands zoned for residential and park development have the highest canopy cover relative to other land uses. Yet, little research has explored whether this conclusion holds across scales of analysis and how it might influence our understanding of potential canopy cover and relative canopy cover. Thus, we ask, does the nature of the relationship between zoning and canopy cover change between aggregated and disaggregated zoning scales and how might this knowledge improve the sustainability of urban forest management? To answer this question, we classified high resolution National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) images of Bloomington, Indiana land cover and compared existing, potential and relative canopy cover across aggregated and disaggregated zones. Results demonstrate an important exception to the oft-cited theory that residential lands have higher canopy cover, a conclusion that our data supports only at the scale of an aggregated interpretation of zoning. At a disaggregated scale, residential high density zones are significantly different than all other residential zones and more akin to commercial zones in terms of all canopy metrics. For urban forest managers and urban planners, this suggests the relevance of fine-scale variation in land-use policies and related canopy cover policies.},

The diversified Nymphalidae butterflies (38–213 species) and especially two fermented-bait-attracted groups (Satyrinae, 2–30 species, and Biblidini, 9–44 species), are among the more useful indicators of the quality and diversity of the environments in these fragments. Effective conservation of butterfly communities in tropical cities may be achieved by maintenance of arboreal green corridors along streets and watercourses between moderately large ({\textgreater}10 ha) humid areas, not near to the most built-up or polluted city centre(s), and the inclusion within these areas of ponds or streams, diversified native forest, and open vegetation including abundant nectar-rich flowers.},

Urban ecology studies demonstrate that bird species richness is negatively related to increased urbanization. Nevertheless, our understanding of the processes that determine how bird communities respond to urbanization is still rudimentary. In particular, there is lack of studies investigating the dynamics of urban bird communities in tropical areas. I explored the effects of human-influenced attributes on bird richness at eight plots within a suburb in tropical Guadalajara, Mexico. Results of this study suggest that tree foliar cover and maximum tree height are predictors of bird species richness at this site. Additionally, tree foliar cover was related to which trophic guilds dominated the avian community. In order to assist in the maintenance and promotion of native bird species within tropical urbanized areas, I suggest three urban planning and management activities: (1) the evaluation of fast growing, tall, wide-ranging foliar cover tree species native to the study area, (2) the increase of green area extension with the selected tree species along the urbanized area, and (3) the use of urban ecology research recommendations into managing and developmental plans.},

Forest dependent species, including arboreal mammals, are particularly sensitive to these changes due to their highly specific habitat requirements and inability or reluctance to cross the urban matrix. We addressed this problem using a case study of the squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) in fragmented urban landscapes of southeast Queensland, Australia. We applied a mixed effect modeling approach clustered by patch to quantify the importance of site-level habitat factors relative to edge contrast and habitat patch size on squirrel glider abundance. Analysis of variance was used to test for differences in glider age and sex in interior habitats compared to road and residential edges. We found that edge contrast had a strong negative effect on the abundance of squirrel gliders but is conditional on the presence of a low numbers of unreliable flowering overstorey trees and the availability of critical resources such as nest hollows at a site. We also found that older male gliders prefer forest fragment interiors over road and residential edge habitats. We conclude that although interior habitats are ideal to maintain large stable populations, the conservation value of low contrast edges containing key site-level resources should not be underestimated for arboreal mammals such as the squirrel glider.},

A statistical method based on a generalization of the hypergeometric distribution was used to derive weekly time-series estimates of the population sizes. To describe the population dynamics, a stage structured mathematical model was developed and compared to time-series obtained from the weekly population estimates study using a least-squares approach. Two fitting experiments were done: (1) Using uniform distribution for the birth rate during the breeding season; (2) Using a birth rate distributed according to weekly data on frog calling intensity. Although both model-to-data fits look very promising during the years 2004 and 2005 and result in similar inherent survivorship rates for the tadpoles, juvenile and adult frogs, the fit that uses the calling data predicts a lower number of tadpoles and frogs in the long term than the one that uses uniform birth distribution. The parameter estimates resulting from these fitting experiments are used in the context of stochastic simulations to derive extinction and persistence probabilities for this population. Due to the oscillatory dynamics (with high amplitude) evidenced by the capture–recapture data and corroborated by the model, it is suggested that anuran monitoring efforts should take into account the natural intra-annual variation in population size.},

Conversely, total, native, and exotic tree species richness were highest in land uses with intermediate levels of urban development (residential, residential-commercial areas). Not finding highest tree species richness in less developed urban areas suggests that cultural factors may shape the array of species that are planted within cities. Supporting this, tree composition analyses showed that green areas are comprised of different tree species when compared to the rest of the studied urban land uses. Thus, our results suggest that, to increase the ecological quality of cities, residents and managers should be encouraged to select a greater variety of trees to promote heterogeneous green areas.},

Additionally, the majority of studies examining urban forest patterns focus on canopy cover extent, with less attention given to patterns of species diversity. This study explores how tree species diversity varies across different urban land uses and municipal boundaries to better understand the role of land use types in shaping urban forest patterns. The goal is addressed through an exploration of plot-level tree data in the urban municipalities of Peel Region located in the Greater Toronto Area (Ontario, Canada). Species composition and standard diversity metrics are calculated for eight land use types and four municipalities. Our results show that differences in diversity metrics and species composition are greater between urban land uses than municipalities. Moreover, Peel’s urban forest has relatively high alpha diversity but many species are present on only one land use type. The results suggest that different causal processes are associated with each land use type, and that urban forest managers should adopt land use-specific strategies to meet species composition goals within the urban forest.},

These studies have focused on understanding the distribution of plants and animals as well as ecosystem processes along gradients of urbanization that run from densely urbanized inner city to more rural exurban environments. We reviewed 300 papers investigating urbanization gradients that were published in peer-reviewed journals between 1990 and May 2007. Sixty-three percent of the papers investigated the distribution of organisms along urbanization gradients. Only five papers addressed the measures used to quantify the urbanization gradient itself. Within the papers addressing the distribution of organisms, 49\% investigated the responses of birds to urbanization gradients, and {\textless}10\% of the papers investigated more cryptic organisms. Most of these studies utilized a variety of broad measures of urbanization, but future advances in the field will require the development of some standardized broad measures to facilitate comparisons between cities. More specific measures of urbanization can be used to gain a mechanistic understanding of species and ecosystem responses to urbanization gradients. While the gradient approach has made a significant contribution to our understanding of the ecology of cities and towns, there is now a need to address our current knowledge gaps so that the field can reach its full potential. We present two examples of research questions that demonstrate how we can enhance our understanding of urbanization gradients, and the ecological knowledge that we can obtain from them.},

The study emphasised the distribution of native and non-native species, both in absolute numbers and proportionally. The observed differences are explained by the share of forest land, the number of detached houses, distance from the city centre, and human population. Non-natives showed the highest values in suburban areas. Still, the difference in number of non-natives between suburban and central areas was quite small. In the city of Tampere, there are not continuous large areas devoid of vegetation. The number of native species remained high until the urban core and natives dominated in the rural-type areas of the city. However, there was not a great difference in the number of native species between rural and suburban areas. In the suburban areas, the detached houses and block-of-flats have little effect on the general vegetation. Proportionally, the share of natives decreases in line with the urban traits of the city. Urbanisation therefore affects native species in Finland. Overall, the characteristic features of a Finnish city, such as dispersed urban structure, small population, late urbanisation, abundant natural vegetation (forest) and the qualities of Finnish forests, guarantee the continuing diversity of urban vascular plants.},

A main feature of urban floras is the high proportion of non-native species with often divergent distribution patterns along urban–rural gradients. Urban impacts on plant species richness are usually associated with increasing human activity along rural-to-urban gradients. As an important stimulus of urban plant diversity, human-mediated seed dispersal may drive the process of increasing the similarity between urban and rural floras by moving species across urban–rural gradients. We used long motorway tunnels as sampling sites for propagules that are released by vehicles to test for the impact of traffic on seed dispersal along an urban–rural gradient. Opposite lanes of the tunnels are separated by solid walls, allowing us to differentiate seed deposition associated with traffic into vs. out of the city. Both the magnitude of seed deposition and the species richness in seed samples from two motorway tunnels were higher in lanes leading out of the city, indicating an ‘export’ of urban biodiversity by traffic. As proportions of seeds of non-native species were also higher in the outbound lanes, traffic may foster invasion processes starting from cities to the surrounding landscapes. Indicator species analysis revealed that only a few species were confined to samples from lanes leading into the city, while mostly species of urban habitats were significantly associated with samples from the outbound lanes. The findings demonstrate that dispersal by traffic reflects different seed sources that are associated with different traffic directions, and traffic may thus exchange propagules along the urban–rural gradient.},

	abstract = {In order to better understand the effects of urbanization on weed communities, the distribution of weed communities in Shanghai, China, was systematically investigated. The diversity of weed communities and four environmental factors, including the relative light intensity, soil moisture, soil compaction and soil pH, were measured in 1375 plots along an urban–rural gradient. The species diversity indices in each area along the urban–rural gradient were compared by using a one-way ANOVA. The weed communities were identified by using clustering methods that were based on relative dominance information. A canonical correspondence analysis was used to reveal the relationships between the species composition and the environmental factors at the community level and the Spearman's rank correlation test was used to test the relationship between the number of weed communities and each environmental factor. A total of 183 species, belonging to 41 families and 123 genera, was recorded. It was found that the species richness, Shannon–Wiener diversity index and Pielou evenness index followed a unimodal curve along the urban–rural gradient. The 1375 plots were divided into 133 weed community types. All four environmental factors significantly affected the species composition of the weed communities, but only soil compaction had significant effects on the number of weed communities. It was concluded that the diversification of habitat type and environmental change along the urban–rural gradient led to more weed communities in rural areas and fewer weed communities in urban areas. Based on the species' habitats and distribution patterns, the weeds were divided into “widespread”, “urban” and “rural”.},

The objective of this study was to examine forest structure and woody vegetation diversity indices of riparian communities in response to an urbanization gradient in West Georgia, USA. Measures of forest structure and diversity were compared to measures of urbanization and land cover. Although Liquidambar styracifluaand Quercus nigrawere dominant species in the forest stand and regeneration layer for all riparian communities, the invasive, non-native shrub Ligustrum sinense was the most dominant species observed in the regeneration layer for urban, developing, and agriculture communities. The proportion of non-native species in the forest stand and regeneration layer decreased and Shannon diversity of the regeneration layer increased with increasing distance from the urban center. Shifts in diversity indicate that anthropogenic disturbance may subdue the ability of diverse communities to resist non-native plant invasions.},

The plant community showed very little difference between patches along the gradient, particularly in terms of the indigenous plant species. Average annual rainfall was the main factor contributing to patterns of indigenous plant species richness, while the level of urbanization in the surrounding landscape had a strong influence on the number of non-indigenous species recorded in the remnant plant community. Patterns of species richness were largely influenced by landscape-scale factors, while the percent cover of indigenous and non-indigenous plant species were more strongly influenced by patch scale factors. The findings of this study suggest that the plant communities investigated during this study appear to be relatively resilient to changes in the landscape associated with urbanization, but the plant community may be affected by predicted changes in average annual rainfall associated with climate change.},

A study investigating the distribution of non-native plants in the understories of riparian forests across an urban-to-rural gradient north of Columbus, GA was initiated in 2003. A significantly greater number of non-native plant species occurred at the urban sites and at one site at the urban-rural interface, where 20 to 33\% of the species encountered were non-native. In contrast, at the more rural sites non-native species comprised 4–14\% of the total number of species. However, the importance values of non-native species as a whole did not change significantly across the land use gradient due to the high frequency and abundance of three non-native species (Ligustrum sinense, Lonicera japonica, and Microstegium vimineum) in the majority of the watersheds. Reductions in species richness and overstory reproduction associated with these non-natives could impact long-term forest structure and ecosystem function.},

Plant trait-based analyses provide a useful approach for comparing and describing distinct plant communities and may offer a more general understanding of the influences and consequences of disturbance associated with land use on riparian vegetation. This research addressed two primary questions focusing on nine plant traits that may significantly influence ecological processes or function. Are riparian woody plant traits related to the surrounding watershed matrix? Are trends in plant traits that are related to the watershed matrix also evident in the riparian woody plant regeneration layer? Using a rapidly urbanizing region of the southeastern United States near Columbus, GA as an example, data on woody plant species composition were collected from 17 forested watersheds along headwater streams representing an urban-to-rural land use gradient. Land cover and hydrologic indices were used to characterize the watershed landscape matrix at each site. Plant species were described by morphological, physiological, and reproductive trait groups. A site×trait matrix was obtained and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) ordinations were used to identify trends in plant traits. Correlative analyses were used to relate watershed matrix indices to plant traits. Analyses indicated that riparian woody plant traits were related to the surrounding watershed matrix, most notably flood intolerance showed increased importance in urban areas possibly signifying a shift in hydrologic function. Changes in riparian woody plant traits are related to the watershed matrix and may have significant implications for ecological function and structure as urbanization continues.},

A significant difference was found in shrub species community composition among three contrasting land-use categories but no significant difference was found in herbaceous community composition. Significant differences in human activity existed among rural, urban, and urbanizing land-use categories, but this index of disturbance was not significantly correlated to gradients in species composition. All stands in this study had been subjected to various types of human activity and environmental disturbances in the past. Our data suggest that differences in the relative importance of understory species exist among stands but these differences may not be caused by the impacts of urbanization alone. Changes in the natural disturbance regime of this landscape, along with the impacts associated with urbanization, have led to an individualistic response in the compositional dynamics of forest stands.},

The plant communities now common in urban centers may represent new habitats with unique dynamics and the potential for highly modified ecological services. This study, joining extensive spatial and floristic data sets, examined current distribution patterns of non-native and native woody plant species in the New York metropolitan region, USA. We joined the New York Metropolitan Flora (NYMF) database of woody species with GIS data of urban land cover for 297 5 km by 5 km landscape blocks. We tested the relationship between urbanization and native and non-native species richness patterns, the extent of non-native species presence in the urban area, and the change in beta diversity across a gradient of urban land cover. We found that across the urban–rural gradient, native plant species richness decreased and non-native species richness increased with increasing urban land cover. Total richness does not change across the urban–rural gradient. Our analyses show that these patterns are highly correlated with urbanization, but vary across the New Jersey landscape. We also found an increase in beta diversity with urbanization; urban areas are not homogenized in plant species composition compared to rural areas. Here we show a species-rich flora dominated by non-native species which are differentiating the urban flora. These results can help guide appropriate conservation decisions for the maintenance of plant biodiversity in cities.},

Do protected areas, which can be found in both city and countryside, reflect this species richness pattern? The impact of urban land-use might reduce conservation success and necessitate special management strategies. We compared species richness and species spatial turnover of selected animal and plant taxa (carabids, butterflies, snails, birds, lichens, mosses, vascular plants) in 30 protected areas in the city of Halle and 56 protected areas in the adjacent rural district of Saalkreis (Central Germany). Species were mapped by experienced biologists within a systematic species inventory. We corrected species numbers for the effects of landscape structure (e.g. size, shape and distance of habitats) which might influence species diversity beyond urbanisation effects. Butterflies, birds and lichens had significantly higher species numbers in the rural protected areas. Species spatial turnover was higher among urban areas than among rural areas or pairs of urban and rural areas for most taxa. Diversity in all taxa depended on the size of a protected area. We discussed these patterns in the context of the general urban-rural species diversity patterns. Our results indicate an increasing isolation of species assemblages with urbanisation and highlight that space for protected areas is even more limited in urban than rural areas. An effective conservation of urban species diversity should include both typical urban and semi-natural habitats to cover the full range of species living in cities.},

	abstract = {The effect of urbanization on species distribution has been extensively documented, but a main challenge in urban ecology is to better understand the factors causing different distributions among species in response to urbanization. Hence, this paper aims to compare the effects of urbanization on woodland plant assemblages in two cities and to describe species responses by using several indicators. The study was carried out in the cities of Angers and Rennes (North-Western France) where 11 isolated woodlands were surveyed along an urban–rural gradient in each city. Abundance data of spontaneous species were collected from 220 quadrats. The effect of land cover (within a 500 m buffer around each woodland) on species assemblages was investigated by Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Buildings and pavement areas were the most significant predictors of species composition, and the effect of location in Angers or Rennes appeared on the second axis. More than 60\% of the most frequent plant species were indicator of urban or rural location and their preferences were similar in the two cities. These lists of urban and rural indicator species were compared with Ellenberg’s indicator values and two other indicators specific to forest environment. The species which grow preferentially in urban woodlands are species which are already known to be associated with recent forests rather than ancient forests; with hedgerows rather than woodlands. The opposite pattern was observed concerning rural species. Moreover, urban indicator species have higher optima for soil pH and soil nitrogen content than rural indicator species. Different characteristics and history of forest habitat—continuity of the forest land cover, linearity of the habitat, change in adjacent land cover and land use—could select the same species, and the responses of the latter might involve different preferences concerning soil alkalinity and nutrient status.},

            Species occurrence records provide the basis for many biodiversity studies. They derive from geo-referenced specimens deposited in natural history collections and visual observations, such as those obtained through various mobile applications. Given the rapid increase in availability of such data, the control of quality and accuracy constitutes a particular concern. Automatic flagging and filtering are a scalable and reproducible means to identify potentially problematic records in datasets from public databases such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF;
            www.gbif.org
            ). However, it is unclear how much data may be lost by filtering, whether the same tests should be applied across all taxonomic groups, and what is the effect of filtering for common downstream analyses. Here, we evaluate the effect of 13 recently proposed filters on the inference of species richness patterns and automated conservation assessments for 18 Neotropical taxa including animals, fungi, and plants, terrestrial and marine, downloaded from GBIF. We find that 29-90\% of the records are potentially erroneous, with large variation across taxonomic groups. Tests for duplicated information, collection year, basis of record as well as urban areas and coordinates for terrestrial taxa in the sea or marine taxa on land have the greatest effect. While many flagged records might not be
            de facto
            erroneous, they could be overly imprecise and increase uncertainty in downstream analyses. Automated flagging can help in identifying problematic records, but requires customization of which tests and thresholds should be applied to the taxonomic group and geographic area under focus. Our results stress the importance of thorough exploration of the meta-data associated with species records for biodiversity research.},

While important advances have been made in the conceptual development of urban biodiversity research over the last decades, challenges remain in understanding the interactions between different groups of taxa and the spatiotemporal complexity of urbanization processes. The CityScapeLab Berlin is a novel experimental research platform that allows the testing of theories on how urbanization affects biodiversity patterns and biotic interactions in general and the responses of species of conservation interest in particular. We chose dry grassland patches as the backbone of the research platform because dry grasslands are common in many urban regions, extend over a wide urbanization gradient, and usually harbor diverse and self-assembled communities. Focusing on a standardized type of model ecosystem allowed the urbanization effects on biodiversity to be unraveled from effects that would otherwise be masked by habitat- and land-use effects. The CityScapeLab combines different types of spatiotemporal data on (i) various groups of taxa from different trophic levels, (ii) environmental parameters on different spatial scales, and (iii) on land-use history. This allows for the unraveling of the effects of current and historical urban conditions on urban biodiversity patterns and the related ecological functions.},

All continents exhibited a loss in urban tree cover except for Europe; the greatest decrease in percent tree cover was in Africa. Concurrent with tree loss was an increase in impervious cover among all continents, which globally had a statistically significant increase from 24.3 \% to 25.9 \% (326,000 ha/year). Urban tree cover was significantly different among forested (30.6 \%), grassland (18.5 \%) and desert regions (12.6 \%). Understanding global urban cover type variation and changes can improve global assessments and help guide forest management to improve environmental quality in cities.},

	abstract = {Urban green spaces play a crucial role in maintaining urban ecosystem sustainability by providing numerous ecosystem services. How to quantify and evaluate the ecological benefits and services of urban green spaces remains a hot topic currently, while the evaluation is barely applied or implemented in urban design and planning. In this study, super-high-resolution aerial images were used to acquire the spatial distribution of urban green spaces; a modified pre-stratified random sampling method was applied to obtain the vegetation information of the four types of urban green spaces in Luohe, a common plain city in China; and i-Tree Eco model was further used to assess the vegetation structure and various ecosystem services including air quality improvement, rainfall interception, carbon storage, and sequestration provided by four types of urban green spaces. The modeling results reveal that there were about 1,006,251 trees in this area. In 2013, all the trees in these green spaces could store about 54,329 t of carbon, sequester about 4973 t of gross carbon, remove 92 t of air pollutants, and avoid 122,637 m3 of runoff. The study illustrates an innovative method to reveal different types of urban green spaces with distinct ecosystem service productivity capacity to better understand their various roles in regulating the urban environment. The results could be used to assist urban planners and policymakers to optimize urban green space structure and composition to maximize ecosystem services provision.},

	abstract = {Urbanization in the Sahel is constantly competing with and greatly affecting the woody flora in urban areas. Urbanization can replace the species mix, leading to changes in plant community composition; however, there are limited studies that assess these attributes in Sahelian cities. This study assessed urban forests in Niamey and Maradi, two important cities of Niger, West Africa for differences between the cities and across LULC types in terms of species diversity and stand structure. Woody species were inventoried in 357 plots in urban forests located across seven land use/land cover types. Stem diameter at breast height of trees and shrubs ≥2.5 cm, total height and crown diameter were measured. Eighty-six species belonging to 69 genera with 33 families were inventoried in Niamey, while in Maradi 91 species belonging to 70 genera with 30 families were enumerated. Fabaceae was the dominant family in both cities. Azadirachta indica accounted for 41 and 54\% of all stems in Niamey and Maradi. Residential areas had a higher species richness than other land uses. The majority of the species documented in the two cities were exotics representing 52\% of all species encountered. Mean Shannon diversity index (H′) and standard deviation was 2.31 ± 0.43 for Niamey and 2.14 ± 0.74 for Maradi. The similarity index of the two cities was 70\%. Urban forests of Maradi had significantly higher levels of species richness and evenness as well as tree density and canopy cover than urban forests of Niamey. Across LULC types, canopy cover varied significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) but basal area had a marginal variation whilst, stem density was not significantly different. There were significant positive relationships (p {\textless} 0.05) between species richness, basal area and canopy cover across the LULC types in both cities. The study shows that land use/land cover types influence the characteristics of urban forests and differences exist in diversity and stand structural characteristics of urban forests in the two cities. Future development of urban forests in the two cities must increase the planting of native species to improve their value for biodiversity conservation.},

	abstract = {It is through urban biodiversity that the majority of humans experience nature on a daily basis. As cities expand globally, it is increasingly important to understand how biodiversity is shaped by human decisions, institutions, and environments. In some cities, research has documented convergence between high socioeconomic status (SES) and high species diversity. Yet, other studies show that residents with low SES live amid high biodiversity or that SES and biodiversity appear unrelated. This study examines the conditions linked to varying types of relationships between SES and biodiversity. We identified and coded 84 case studies from 34 cities in which researchers assessed SES-biodiversity relationships. We used fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to evaluate combinations of study design and city-level conditions that explain why SES-biodiversity relationships vary city to city and between plants and animals. While the majority of cases demonstrated increased biodiversity in higher SES neighborhoods, we identified circumstances in which inequality in biodiversity distribution was ameliorated or negated by disturbance, urban form, social policy, or collective human preference. Overall, our meta-analysis highlights the contributions of residential and municipal decisions in differentially promoting biodiversity along socioeconomic lines, situated within each city’s environmental and political context. Through identifying conditions under which access to biodiversity is more or less unequal, we call attention to outstanding research questions and raise prospects for better promoting equitable access to biodiversity.},

Explanatory data for each campus was collected, including campus area, campus age, climatic variables (temperature, precipitation) and topography. I investigated drivers of richness patterns for total species, cultured (planted) and endemic species, analysing the data using multiple linear regression. Relative variation importance analysis (RVI) was conducted to test the importance of each variable for all significant regression models. I found that Turkish universities had remarkable plant diversity. Total species richness was driven by campus area while planted species richness was driven by campus age, and endemic species richness was driven by elevation and area. Turkish universities house valuable plant reserves that can be used for educational purposes as well as biodiversity conservation.},

We argue that urban plant communities assemble from a complex mix of horticultural and regional species pools, and evaluate the homogenization hypothesis by comparing cultivated and spontaneously occurring urban vegetation to natural area vegetation across seven major U.S. cities. There was limited support for homogenization of urban diversity, as the cultivated and spontaneous yard flora had greater numbers of species than natural areas, and cultivated phylogenetic diversity was also greater. However, urban yards showed evidence of homogenization of composition and structure. Yards were compositionally more similar across regions than were natural areas, and tree density was less variable in yards than in comparable natural areas. This homogenization of biodiversity likely reflects similar horticultural source pools, homeowner preferences, and management practices across U.S. cities.},

However, evaluating how urban biodiversity responds to urban intensification remains poorly understood because of the challenges in capturing the diversity of a range of taxa within and across multiple cities from different types of urbanization. Here we utilize a growing resource—citizen science data. We analyzed 66,209 observations representing 5,209 species generated by the City Nature Challenge project on the iNaturalist platform, in conjunction with remote sensing (NLCD2011) environmental data, to test for urban biotic homogenization at increasing levels of urban intensity across 14 metropolitan cities in the United States. Based on community composition analyses, we found that while similarities occur to an extent, urban biodiversity is often much more a reflection of the taxa living locally in a region. At the same time, the communities found in high-intensity development were less explained by regional context than communities from other land cover types were. We also found that the most commonly observed species are often shared between cities and are non-endemic and/or have a distribution facilitated by humans. This study highlights the value of citizen science data in answering questions in urban ecology.},

It is necessary to examine the plant species and functional traits composition and the influencing factors. In this study, a field survey was conducted using the tessellation-randomized plot method to assess the plant species and functional traits variability in greenspaces across eight land use types (LUTs) in the built-up areas of Beijing, China. Results showed that the woody plants in the built-up areas of Beijing comprised 85 non-native species (57\%), 21 pollen-allergenic species (14\%), and 99 resistant species (67\%). Residential areas, community parks and institutional areas had higher woody plant species richness than other LUTs. Native and extralimital native species were more widespread than exotic species. Proportions of species with resistances were low except for cold- and drought-resistance; consequently, a high intensity of management and maintenance is essential for survival of plants in this urban area. Caution should be exerted in selecting plant species with resistance to harsh conditions in different LUTs. Housing prices, distances from the urban center, years since the establishment of LUTs and greening rate were strongly correlated with the plant functional traits and species diversity. Urban forest managers should consider plant functional traits and LUT-specific strategies to maximize both forest and human health.},

This study therefore sought to establish tree species composition and diversity, and their variations across six land use types of Zomba city, Malawi. The study results revealed that Zomba city harbours 168 tree species, belonging to 47 families. Of these species, 63.6\% were indigenous. Mangifera indica, an exotic fruit tree, is found among the top three most abundant tree species in three land use types: Roads, residential areas, and institutional land. Shannon diversity index values were different across six land use types, with high values observed in institutional areas (H’=4.08). Species evenness was high in graveyards (EQ=0.31) and low in residential areas (EQ=0.15). Bray-Curtis index revealed high dissimilarity of species composition in all pairs except a pair of institutional land and residential areas (0.67). The pattern was also confirmed using detrended correspondence analysis. The discrepancies in species composition between land use types was associated with difference in their levels of anthropogenic activities. Overall, the study results confirm that urban landscapes in Africa are important depository of tree species composition and diversity that differ with land use type. The influence of other factors to species heterogeneity and importance of such diversity in providing ecosystem services to the urban landscapes needs further investigation.},

However, authoritative reviews find no consensus on how species loss affects function in natural communities. We analyse experimental and observational data in an identical way and test whether they produce similar results. Location North America and Europe (experimental communities); global (natural communities). Time period Experimental communities: 1998–2013; natural communities: 1982–2018. Major taxa studied Experimental communities: temperate grassland plants; natural communities: temperate grassland plants, tropical forest trees, kelp forest producers and native bees. Methods We used an approach inspired by the Price equation to analyse 129 datasets from experimental and natural communities worldwide. We tested how the effects of species loss on ecosystem function varied with dominance and the non-randomness of species loss and, in turn, how these two factors differed between experiments and observations. Results Studies carried out in experimental and natural communities reached different conclusions regarding the effects of species loss. First, species loss had greater effects on ecosystem function in experiments than in nature. Second, the importance of species loss was negatively correlated with dominance in nature because as dominance increased, lost species were increasingly those contributing little to ecosystem function. Although experimental and natural communities exhibited similar levels of dominance, an analogous relationship was not possible in experiments because the order of species loss was randomized by design. Main conclusions Species loss was sometimes, but not always, the major driver of loss of function in nature. Variation in the importance of species loss was not messy and context dependent; instead, it was predicted by functional dominance. Although results from experimental and natural communities were similar in several key ways, they differed in that species loss was a consistent predictor of ecosystem function in experiments and not in nature.},

We find that species composition has changed dramatically and directionally across all regions. Substantial species losses were more than offset by large gains, resulting in a net increase in species richness in all regions. The occupancy of initially widespread species increased, while initially rare species lost terrain. These changes were accompanied by strong biotic homogenization; i.e. regions are more similar now than they were 140 years ago.

Urban gardening is a common practice in many industrialised and developing countries. The ability of urban vegetable gardens to support biodiversity, however, has yet to be studied in depth. To investigate the responses of flora and soil fauna to urbanization, we surveyed the taxonomic and functional composition of plant and collembolan communities, in addition to soil parameters, in 15 urban vegetable gardens across three large French cities. The vegetation was identified in six plots of 1 × 1 m in each urban vegetable garden and collembolan were extracted from one intact soil core sampled in the center of each plot (5 cm depth, 6 cm diameter). We found contrasting effects of urbanization on plants and Collembola biodiversity. The taxonomic and functional composition of the soil fauna was more similar within cities than among cities, which was driven by similarities in soil parameters. In contrast, plant communities were functionally similar among cities. Understanding the effects of urbanization on soil biodiversity could have implications for the management of urban ecosystems, in particular that of urban soils.},

We assemble criteria for an appropriate index for the evenness of a biological sample. The most important criterion is that evenness should be independent of species richness. Twelve previously proposed indices and variants are considered, and two apparently new indices. Four indices are recommended as joint best buys: A) If symmetry between minor and abundant species is not important, or if it is required that the index be less affected by minor species: 1) If it is essential that the index be able to reach a minimum of zero with any particular number of species, or if the shape of the index response to an evenness gradient is important: E$_{\textrm{1/D}}$ (based on a common form of Simpson's index). 2) If good mid-range behaviour is desired: E$^{\textrm{′}}$ (proposed by Camargo). B) If equal sensitivity to minor and abundant species is required: 1) If the shape of the index response to an evenness gradient is not important, the clear winner is: E$_{\textrm{Q}}$ (a new index). 2) If the shape is important: E$_{\textrm{var}}$ (another new index).

	abstract = {Species abundance distributions (SADs) have played a historical role in the development of community ecology. They summarize information about the number and the relative abundance of the species encountered in a sample from a given community. For years ecologists have developed theory to characterize species abundance patterns, and the study of these patterns has received special attention in recent years. In particular, ecologists have developed statistical sampling theories to predict the SAD expected in a sample taken from a region. Here, we emphasize an important limitation of all current sampling theories: they ignore species identity. We present an alternative formulation of statistical sampling theory that incorporates species asymmetries in sampling and dynamics, and relate, in a general way, the community-level SAD to the distribution of population abundances of the species integrating the community. We illustrate the theory on a stochastic community model that can accommodate species asymmetry. Finally, we discuss the potentially important role of species asymmetries in shaping recently observed multi-humped SADs and in comparisons of the relative success of niche and neutral theories at predicting SADs.},

We investigated the relationship of the abundances of 10 invasive species to variables of urban spatial structure [land use (houses, apartments, commercial/industrial, or vacant), impervious surface, distance from city center, distance from forest preserve, income] at an individual block scale of analysis. Eighty blocks (about 2ha each) distributed along a 15-mile (24km) transect from the center of Chicago, IL, USA west to the county line were inventoried for abundance of three woody species, five biennial forbs and two grasses. Nine of the ten invasive species were found, with an average of 2.74 of our 10 species per block. Collectively, abundance was negatively related to percent impervious surface, and presence was negatively related to local income. No invasive species’ abundance was structured by distance and only one of the 10 species, burdock, had any significant correlations with land use. This general lack of connection to urban land use is surprising and suggests most plant species find opportunities for colonization and reproduction independent of land use in the built urban environment. There is also evidence that the built urban environment may be a sink for these invasive plant species, with populations in forest preserves sending more propagules into the built environment than they receive from it.},

	abstract = {AimUsing a large database that has been created over the past 5 years with the RECORDER package, presence/absence data for 829 species of vascular plants in the 103 1-km2 squares that cover the city of Plymouth (pop. 243,373) have been analysed by two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to establish the major species assemblages and to examine their spatial distribution across the city in relation to variation in land use. LocationThe City of Plymouth. MethodsNine groupings of squares emerged and their distribution was mapped across the city. Interpretation of those groups and their variation in relation to the land use ordination axes showed that TWINSPAN groups lying along the first axis of variation correlated floristic variation with the process of urban development and the historical evolution of urban structure. The second axis appeared to be related to particular remnant semi-natural habitats within the city that could be regarded as ‘hot-spots’ for survival of many plant species. Species were categorized into four types on the basis of their recency and mode of arrival in the city and by using the historical flora of Plymouth produced by T. R. Archer-Briggs in 1880. Variations in the sources of species in relation to the TWINSPAN classification groups were then examined. A second ordination was also computed; this time with geological, altitudinal and distance variables. TWINSPAN groups were then superimposed on the ordinations using polygons to assist with biogeographical interpretation. Results and conclusions The results of both the multivariate analyses and distribution of species by source are then discussed in the context of previous research into urban plant ecology, particularly in Central Europe. The problems of inferring process from pattern in this meso-scale study are reviewed and suggestions are made for further research into urban ecology and biogeography in the city.},

	abstract = {The ecological sustainability and function of urban landscapes is strongly influenced by the composition and structure of the local plant community. Taxonomic composition generally refers to the identity of the species comprising the community, while we define structure as the presence of multiple canopy layers, as well as stems of varying diameter and age. These aspects of urban vegetation significantly influence the ecology of cities, yet they are generally poorly quantified across the range of natural and constructed plant communities present in urban landscapes. We quantified vegetation composition and structure to i) simultaneously assess their variation across four green spaces types (golf courses, public parks, residential neighbourhoods and patches of remnant vegetation) in Melbourne, Australia, and ii) investigate the relationship between vegetation composition and structure within these green spaces. The four green space types supported distinctly different plant communities. Vegetation composition in the residential neighborhoods differed significantly from the others (p{\textless}0.05), largely due to the increased richness of shrubs and cultivated plants, and the reduced presence of large trees. Residential neighborhoods had the highest plant species richness, although a large proportion of these species occurred infrequently. The structural complexity of understorey vegetation (calculated as \% volume occupied) below 0.5 m was highest in remnant patches followed by golf courses, public parks and residential neighborhoods. The structural complexity of understorey vegetation in remnant vegetation patches was very similar to that of golf courses even though some of the latter were dominated by exotic plant species. Variation in the composition and structure of urban vegetation might have great implications for the retention of faunal diversity within cities because different taxa have specific habitat requirements. Hence, further understanding of variations in the composition and structure of both natural and constructed plant communities in cities will greatly improve our ability to create urban landscapes that enhance both plant and animal biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Urban forests adjacent to interstate corridors are understudied ecosystems across cities. Despite their small area, these forests may be strategically located to provide large ecosystem services due to their ability to act as a barrier against air pollutants and noise as well as to provide flood control. The woody vegetation composition and structure of forests adjacent to urban interstates is an important determinant of their ability to provide these services. However, these forest communities may be particularly susceptible to the introduction of exotic invasive species via the interstate and the surrounding city that can potentially alter current and future forest composition. The purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of native and exotic woody vegetation and tree regeneration in forests along three interstate corridors in Louisville, KY, and to determine potential factors (e.g., traffic density) that are correlated with patterns in the woody vegetation community. We found the most important determinants of vegetation composition along these interstate corridors were the distance from the city center and the presence of an exotic invasive shrub, Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii). Compared with forested plots within 10 km of the city center, plots further from the city center had 81\% lower stem density of Amur honeysuckle, 96\% higher tree seedling regeneration, and 51\% greater woody plant species richness. The primarily native species composition of adult trees in forests alongside urban interstates in Louisville and the regeneration of native tree species provide optimism that these forests can maintain native species while experiencing multiple impacts from the interstate as well as from the surrounding city, emphasizing their important potential for maintaining natural forest functions across the urban landscape.},

	abstract = {Golf courses have historically been seen as places of heavy pesticide and fertilizer use, however, there are few scientific studies on the ecology of golf courses. The aim of this study was to assess the value of golf courses for conserving forest biota in urban landscapes. The biota occurring in 12 Japanese golf courses and their surrounding areas was investigated. Investigations were done at golf course sites located on the green, fairway, rough, green belts between holes, and the out of bounds forest. Roadside, paddy fields, park and forest sites were investigated outside the golf courses. Presence/absence data for plants, arthropods and vertebrates in each sample habitat were analysed by TWINSPAN. As a result, communities in golf courses were classified by the part of course (e.g. green, fairway), and not by the location of the course nor chemical use. However, differences between golf courses in urban and rural landscapes were detected in the biota of the whole course. The out of bounds forest of golf courses was similar to forests that exist outside the courses, and this area held more flora and fauna than turf vegetation and artificial biotopes outside the course such as roadside and paddy. This suggests that golf courses in urbanised areas can be a refuge for flora and fauna, since forest cover occurs in only limited proportions in urban landscapes. Furthermore, the application of regulations for golf course construction seemed to be useful in maintaining forest species on golf courses. This may contribute to the conservation of native forest biota within Japanese urban landscapes.},

To date little has been done to consider the role of urban school yards in biodiversity conservation in Southern Africa. Our study therefore investigated the role of urban school yards in biodiversity conservation across an urban gradient in the city of Harare, Zimbabwe. Ten schools were randomly selected from each stratum, low, medium and high density suburbs. School yards were surveyed for herbs (garden flowers) and woody plants (trees and shrubs). For α diversity, species richness, Shannon and Simpson diversity indices were computed using the Hill numbers. Variation in species composition among schools was assessed using beta diversity (βSOR) and its components (βSIM and βSNE). A total of 120 tree species belonging to 43 families and 89 garden flowers belonging to 41 families were identified and recorded in school yards from the different suburb densities. Schools in medium density suburbs had highest species richness, Shannon, Simpson and beta diversity indices for indigenous trees compared with those in the low and high density suburbs. For garden flowers, there was no variation in species richness, Shannon, Simpson and beta indices across school yards from low, medium and high density suburbs. Our results demonstrate the important role of urban school yards in biodiversity conservation in general, though there is species homogenization of garden flowers and exotic trees across the urban landscape.},

	abstract = {Land use is expanding and intensifying in the unprotected lands surrounding many of the world's protected areas. The influence of this land use change on ecological processes is poorly understood. The goal of this paper is to draw on ecological theory to provide a synthetic framework for understanding how land use change around protected areas may alter ecological processes and biodiversity within protected areas and to provide a basis for identifying scientifically based management alternatives. We first present a conceptual model of protected areas embedded within larger ecosystems that often include surrounding human land use. Drawing on case studies in this Invited Feature, we then explore a comprehensive set of ecological mechanisms by which land use on surrounding lands may influence ecological processes and biodiversity within reserves. These mechanisms involve changes in ecosystem size, with implications for minimum dynamic area, species–area effect, and trophic structure; altered flows of materials and disturbances into and out of reserves; effects on crucial habitats for seasonal and migration movements and population source/sink dynamics; and exposure to humans through hunting, poaching, exotics species, and disease. These ecological mechanisms provide a basis for assessing the vulnerability of protected areas to land use. They also suggest criteria for designing regional management to sustain protected areas in the context of surrounding human land use. These design criteria include maximizing the area of functional habitats, identifying and maintaining ecological process zones, maintaining key migration and source habitats, and managing human proximity and edge effects.},

	abstract = {Macroecological studies infer ecological processes based on observed patterns. An often used measure of pattern is the species-area curve. Insufficient attention has been paid to the variety of methods used to construct those curves. There are six different methods based on different combinations of: (1) the pattern of quadrats or areas sampled (nested, contiguous, noncontiguous, or island); (2) whether successively larger areas are constructed in a spatially explicit fashion or not; and (3) whether the curve is constructed from single values or mean values. The resulting six types of curves differ in their shapes, how diversity is encapsulated, and the scales encompassed. Inventory diversity (α) can either represent a single value or a mean value, creating a difference in the focus of the measure. Differentiation diversity (β) can vary in the extent encompassed, and thus the spatial scale, depending on the pattern of quadrat placement. Species-area curves are used for a variety of purposes: extrapolation, setting a common grain, and hypothesis testing. The six types of curves differ in how they are used or interpreted in these contexts. A failure to recognize these differences can result in improper conclusions. Further work is needed to understand the sampling and measurement properties of the different types of species-area curves.},

	Many studies have been conducted on the flora of Togo. However, none of them is devoted to the ornamental flora horticulture. This survey aims to establish an inventory of the woody plant species in urban forests of Lom\&eacute;, the capital town of Togo. It covers the trees planted along the avenues, in the gardens, courtyards, shady trees and trees used as fences for houses or trees at the seaside. In total, 297 plant species belong to 141 genera and 48 families were recorded. They are dominated by 79\% of dicotyledonous, 13\% of monocotyledonous and 8\% of gymnosperms. Families that are best represented in terms of species are those of the Euphorbiaceae, Arecaceae and Acanthaceae. Alien species represent 69\% and African species represent 31\% out of which 6\% are from Togo. According to the current threatening of the natural habitat by human activities, African native plant species could be more useful for ornamental purposes than exotic plants.

	abstract = {Aim We propose and test a climate tolerance and trait choice hypothesis of urban macroecological variation in which strong filtering associated with low winter temperatures restricts urban biodiversity while weak filtering associated with warmer temperatures and irrigation allows dispersal of species from a global source pool, thereby increasing urban biodiversity. Location Twenty cities across the USA and Canada. Methods We examined variation in tree community taxonomic diversity, origins and production of an aesthetic ecosystem service trait in a cross-section of urban field surveys. We correlated urban tree community composition indicators with a key climate restriction, namely mean minimum winter temperature, and evaluated alternative possible drivers: precipitation, summer maximum temperature, population size and the percentage of adults with a college education. Results Species accumulation curves differed substantially among cities, with observed richness varying from 22 to 122 species. Similarities in tree communities decreased exponentially with increases in climatic differences. Ordination of tree communities showed strong separation among cities with component axes correlated with minimum winter temperature and annual precipitation. Variation among urban tree communities in richness, origins and the provisioning of an aesthetic ecosystem service were all correlated with minimum winter temperature. Main conclusions The urban climate tolerance and trait choice hypothesis provides a coherent mechanism to explain the large variation among urban tree communities resulting from an interacting environment, species and human decisions. Reconciling the feedbacks between human decision making and biophysical limitations provides a foundation for an urban ecological theory that can better understand and predict the dynamics of other linked biotic communities, associated ecosystem dynamics and resulting services provided to urban residents.},

However tree species differ considerably in the numbers of invertebrates they support, with potential consequences for higher trophic groups such as birds. In this study the influence of native and non-native trees on the abundance of insects (Hemiptera) and the incidence of insectivorous birds (Paridae) were investigated in the southern English town of Bracknell. The number and species of tree were recorded from each of 17 roundabout and parkland sites. Tree beating was used to sample arboreal Hemiptera and Paridae were recorded either with point counts and transect walks, depending on the size of the site. Due to the great variation between tree species, there was no overall significant difference in species richness or abundance of Hemiptera between native and non-native tree species. However, individual native trees had more species and individuals than non-natives. The proportion of native trees at Bracknell sites was positively related to the abundance of both Hemiptera and the number of Paridae observed. The consequences of vegetation type for insect abundance indicates that in order to sustain and enhance urban biodiversity, careful consideration needs to be given to species of trees present in urban areas.},

Trees with ≥10cm girths at breast height (gbh) were inventoried. We recorded 45 species in 42 genera and 21 families. Caesalpiniaceae and Fabaceae each with 6 species dominated the study area followed by Arecaceae (3). Density and stand basal area of the present study were 500stemsha−1 and 64.16m2, respectively. Most of the inventoried trees were native (31 species) and deciduous (28 species). Fabaceae and Caesalpiniaceae dominated the present study area in terms of stand basal area and density. The Shannon diversity index and evenness of study area were 2.79 and 0.73, respectively. The most important species and families based on species important value index (IVI) and family important value index were Albizia saman, Polyalthia longifolia and Azadirachta indica; Fabaceae, Caesalpiniaceae and Annonaceae respectively.

It was applied to different European cities. A set of indicators representing important urban ecosystem goods and services – local climate regulation, air cooling and recreation – was tested using spatial data along an urban–rural gradient. The results show that there is neither a typical rural–urban gradient in terms of urban ecosystem service provisioning nor a uniform urban spatial pattern of service provisioning that can serve as a generic model for cities. The results demonstrate that (1) core cities do not necessarily provide fewer ecosystem services compared to their regions and (2) there were no patches found within the four case study cities where all of the indicators report very high performance values. The analysis further shows that a high degree of imperviousness does not necessarily entail low ecosystem service provisioning if an urban structure contains a considerable amount of mature trees which support carbon storage and biodiversity. The results of the present paper provide insights into potentials and trade-offs between different urban ecosystem services that should be considered during urban planning when setting targets and establishing thresholds to protect environmental resources, ecosystem services and biodiversity for residents.},

USV had higher indicator values for habitat provisioning (plant species diversity, invertebrate abundance and taxonomic diversity) than the other habitats. Indicators of climatic regulatory services (albedo and leaf area index) in USV were similar to those in lawn habitats. Organic carbon content of the soils, an indicator of carbon storage, was lowest in USV but only marginally lower than in lawns. Standing biomass, an indicator of production services, was lowest in USV but lawn production may have been overestimated. While USV sites are usually transitory components of the urban landscape, they deserve further consideration due to their provision of ecosystem services, in some cases to a greater extent than conventionally valued urban habitats.},

While robust evidence exists that plant physiology, abundance, and distribution within cities are basic parameters affecting the magnitude and efficiency of air pollution removal, little is known about effects of plant diversity on the stability of this ecosystem service. Here, by means of a spatial analysis integrating system dynamic modeling and geostatistics, we assessed the effects of tree diversity on the removal of tropospheric ozone (O3) in Rome, Italy, in two years (2003 and 2004) that were very different for climatic conditions and ozone levels. Different tree functional groups showed complementary uptake patterns, related to tree physiology and phenology, maintaining a stable community function across different climatic conditions. Our results, although depending on the city-specific conditions of the studied area, suggest a higher function stability at increasing diversity levels in urban ecosystems. In Rome, such ecosystem services, based on published unitary costs of externalities and of mortality associated with O3, can be prudently valued to roughly US\$2 and \$3 million/year, respectively.},

	abstract = {Homegardens (HG) can play a key role in the conservation of plant diversity and at the same time provide ecosystem services that have a direct and positive impact on human welfare. The relationships among plant diversity, ecosystem services, and the factors that influence them formed the subject of study in tropical HG in Sangay, Ecuador. We compiled information from 138 HG in 11 localities and found 484 plant species associated with 20 ecosystem services, the most important of which, according to interviews with the gardeners, provide food, medicine and ornamentation. Influential physical factors on plant diversity in the HG were altitude, precipitation and temperature, while socioeconomic factors, including ethnicity, gender, income and education, were perhaps more important determinants of HG diversity. Three groups of HG were identified by Hierarchical Ascendant Correspondence Analysis: “small HG of recent origin,” having the fewest species and ecosystem services, “large, transitional HG,” having a wide range of services, and “medium, established HG,” mainly supplying food, medicine, ornamentation, shade and fencing. Ethnicity may be a stronger determinant of differences in HG composition: for Shuar people, HG were a main source of food, critical to their subsistence in rural areas; in total, Shuar gardeners cultivated on the whole more plant species. On the other hand, HG belonging to mestizos were more diverse, have more exotic plant species, and provide mainly cultural and regulatory services. HG in more urban settings mainly provided ornamentation, fencing and shade. This information can be applied by policy makers to the design of strategies for biodiversity conservation and food security.},

We quantified abundance, richness, diversity, and size class of native and exotic tree species on inner-city vacant lots, inner-city residential lots, and suburban residential lots, and used i-Tree Eco to model the quantity and economic value of regulating ecosystem services provided by their respective forest assemblages. Inner-city vacant lots supported three times as many trees, more exotic than native trees, and greater tree diversity than inner-city and suburban residential lots, with the plurality of trees being naturally-regenerated saplings. The urban forest on inner-city vacant lots also had two times as much leaf area and leaf biomass, and more tree canopy cover. The quantity and monetary value of ecosystem services provided by the urban forest was greatest on inner-city vacant lots, with exotic species contributing most of that value, while native taxa provided more monetary value on residential lots. The predominately naturally-regenerated, minimally managed exotic species on vacant land provide valuable ecosystem services to inner-city neighborhoods of Cleveland, OH.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity is known to play a fundamental role in ecosystem functioning and thus may positively influence the provision of ecosystem services with benefits to society. There is a need for further understanding of how specific components of biodiversity are affecting service provision. In this context, terrestrial plants are a particularly important component of biodiversity and one for which a wealth of information on biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships is available. In this paper, we consider terrestrial plants as providers of ecosystem services and analyze whether manipulating plant diversity has an effect on the magnitude of ecosystem service provision using a meta-analysis of 197 effect sizes and a vote-counting analysis of 361 significance tests. The results of these analyses are compared with those of a previous meta-analysis that included a wide diversity of service providers. We produce a synthesis table to explicitly link plants as service providers to indicators of ecosystem properties and these to ecosystem services. By focusing on only plants, we found a clear positive effect of biodiversity on six out of eight services analyzed (provisioning of plant products, erosion control, invasion resistance, pest regulation, pathogen regulation and soil fertility regulation). When controlling for pseudoreplication (repeated records from single studies), we found that four of the six positive effects remained significant; only pest regulation and soil fertility showed non-significant effects. Further expanding our basis for inference with the vote-counting analysis corroborated these results, demonstrating that quantitative meta-analysis and vote-counting methods are both useful methods to synthesize biodiversity–ecosystem service studies. Notwithstanding the restricted number of identified services, our results point to the importance of maintaining plant diversity to ensure and increased provision of ecosystem services which benefit human well-being.
Zusammenfassung
Zahlreiche Studien zeigen, dass Biodiversität einen positiven Einfluss auf Ökosystemfunktionen im Allgemeinen hat. Verschiedene dieser Ökosystemfunktionen können von Nutzen für die Gesellschaft sein. Es stellt sich daher die Frage, wie diese sogenannten Ökosystemdienstleistungen im Besonderen durch Biodiversität und ihre Komponenten beeinflusst werden. In diesem Zusammenhang spielen Landökosysteme und hier in erster Linie eine diverse Vegetation eine entscheidende Rolle. Zudem ist die Faktenlage hinsichtlich des Einflusses pflanzlicher Biodiversität auf die Funktionsfähigkeit von Landökosystemen besonders gut. Wir verwenden diese Fakten in zwei Meta-Analysen, um den Einfluss pflanzlicher Biodiversität auf Ökosystemdienstleitungen zu beschreiben. In der ersten Analyse verwenden wir Effektgrössen aus 197 untersuchten Beziehungen, in der zweiten Analyse Signifikanzen aus 361 Beziehungen. Die Synthese der analysierten Beziehungen wird in einer Tabelle dargestellt, welche die pflanzliche Biodiversität als Leistungserbringer mit Gruppen von Ökosystemfunktionen (Indikatoren) und diese mit Ökosystemdienstleistungen in Beziehung setzt. Durch die Fokussierung auf einen Leistungserbringer wurden in der ersten Analyse signifikante positive Effekte der Biodiversität auf sechs von acht untersuchten Ökosystemdienstleistungen sichtbar: Pflanzenproduktivität, Erosionsvermeidung, Kontrolle invasiver Arten, Regulation von Schädlingspopulationen, Regulation von Pflanzenkrankheiten und Erhalt der Bodenfruchtbarkeit. Die zweite Analyse bestätigte diese Resultate. Gleichzeitig konnte durch den Vergleich der beiden Analysen gezeigt werden, dass nicht nur Studien mit Effektgrössen sondern auch solche mit Signifikanzen Sinn machen, insbesondere wenn mit Signifikanzen eine grössere Population von Studien erschlossen werden kann. Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen, dass durch den Schutz und die Förderung pflanzlicher Biodiversität Ökosystemdienstleistungen gesteigert werden können und somit direkter Nutzen für die Gesellschaft erzeugt werden kann.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity experiments have generated robust empirical results supporting the hypothesis that ecosystems function better when they contain more species. Given that ecosystems provide services that are valued by humans, this inevitably suggests that the loss of species from natural ecosystems could diminish their value. This raises two important questions. First, will experimental results translate into the real world, where species are being lost at an alarming rate? And second, what are the benefits and pitfalls of such valuation exercises? We argue that the empirical results obtained in experiments are entirely consistent with well-established theories of species coexistence. We then examine the current body of work through the lens of niche theory and highlight where closer links with theory could open up opportunities for future research. We argue that niche theory predicts that diversity–functioning relationships are likely to be stronger (and require more species) in the field than in simplified experimental settings. However, we caution that while many of the biological processes that promote coexistence can also generate diversity–function relationships, there is no simple mapping between the two. This implies that valuation exercises need to proceed with care.},

	abstract = {Species loss can impact ecosystem functioning, but no general framework for analyzing these impacts exists. Here I derive a general partitioning of the effects of species loss on any ecosystem function comprising the summed contributions of individual species (e.g., primary productivity). The approach partitions the difference in ecosystem function between two sites (a “pre-loss” site, and a “post-loss” site comprising a strict subset of the species at the pre-loss site) into additive components attributable to different effects. The approach does not assume a particular experimental design or require monoculture data, making it more general than previous approaches. Using the Price Equation from evolutionary biology, I show that three distinct effects cause ecosystem function to vary between sites: the “species richness effect” (SRE; random loss of species richness), the “species composition effect” (SCE; nonrandom loss of high- or low-functioning species), and the “context dependence effect” (CDE; post-loss changes in the functioning of the remaining species). The SRE reduces ecosystem function without altering mean function per species. The SCE is analogous to natural selection in evolution. Nonrandom loss of, for example, high-functioning species will reduce mean function per species, and thus total function, just as selection against large individuals in an evolving population reduces mean body size in the next generation. The CDE is analogous to imperfect transmission in evolution. For instance, any factor (e.g., an environmental change) causing offspring to attain smaller body sizes than their parents (imperfect transmission) will reduce the mean body size in the next generation. Analogously, any factor causing the species remaining at the post-loss site to make smaller functional contributions than at the pre-loss site will reduce mean function per species, and thus total function. I use published data to illustrate how this new partition generalizes previous approaches, facilitates comparative analyses, and generates new empirical insights. In particular, the SCE often is less important than other effects.},

Yet, in heterogeneous forests, ecosystem function of different strata could be associated with traits or evolutionary relationships differently. Here, we integrate phylogenies and traits to evaluate the effects of elevational diversity on above-ground biomass across forest strata and spatial scales. Community-weighted means of height and leaf phosphorous concentration and functional diversity in specific leaf area exhibited positive correlations with tree biomass, suggesting that both positive selection effects and complementarity occur. However, high shrub biomass is associated with greater dissimilarity in seed mass and multidimensional trait space, while species richness or phylogenetic diversity is the most important predictor for herbaceous biomass, indicating that species complementarity is especially important for understory function. The strength of diversity-biomass relationships increases at larger spatial scales. We conclude that strata- and scale- dependent assessments of community structure and function are needed to fully understand how biodiversity influences ecosystem function.},

	abstract = {Among the main effects of human activities on the environment are land use and resulting land cover changes. Such changes impact the capacity of ecosystems to provide goods and services to the human society. This supply of multiple goods and services by nature should match the demands of the society, if self-sustaining human–environmental systems and a sustainable utilization of natural capital are to be achieved. To describe respective states and dynamics, appropriate indicators and data for their quantification, including quantitative and qualitative assessments, are needed. By linking land cover information from, e.g. remote sensing, land survey and GIS with data from monitoring, statistics, modeling or interviews, ecosystem service supply and demand can be assessed and transferred to different spatial and temporal scales. The results reveal patterns of human activities over time and space as well as the capacities of different ecosystems to provide ecosystem services under changing land use. Also the locations of respective demands for these services can be determined. As maps are powerful tools, they hold high potentials for visualization of complex phenomena. We present an easy-to-apply concept based on a matrix linking spatially explicit biophysical landscape units to ecological integrity, ecosystem service supply and demand. An exemplary application for energy supply and demand in a central German case study region and respective maps for the years 1990 and 2007 are presented. Based on these data, the concept for an appropriate quantification and related spatial visualization of ecosystem service supply and demand is elaborated and discussed.},

	abstract = {Central Park is iconic Green Infrastructure that provides myriad ecosystem services to New York City that have significant economic value. We used the market value of Central Park as developable real estate as a proxy measure of the minimum value of the ecosystem services provided by Central Park. We present \$500 billion as a reasonable estimate of the market value of Central Park as developable real estate. We assume this \$500 billion of natural capital converted to money could earn a 5\% annual return (\$25 Billion per year). This return is an estimate of the value of annual ecosystem services provided by the 341 ha that constitute Central Park. This is over \$70 million per hectare per year which is orders of magnitude higher than the estimated value of ecosystem services provided by the most valuable biomes of previous estimates. The very high value of the ecosystem services provided by Central Park result from an interaction of social, natural, human, and built capital. These interactions are poorly addressed from the dominant economic worldview that governs social and environmental policy today. These findings also suggest that the ‘up vs. out’ questions associated with sustainable urban development do not have simple answers.},

In this context, assessing the relationship between rapid urban expansion and ecosystem services play an important role for the urban sustainability and development related to planning and policies. This study mainly focuses on the assessment of the dynamic nature of urbanization and its impact on urban ecosystem services through land use and land cover (LULC) changes of Old Malda Municipal town, Eastern India. The ecosystem service values (ESVs) are analyzed using Remote Sensing data and GIS techniques corresponding with the global Value Coefficient (VC) for four-time periods (1990, 2000, 2010 and 2017) to estimate total ecosystem service values (ESVt) and individual ecosystem service function change. Coefficient of Sensitivity (CS) is also applied to test the reliability of the estimated VC used as proxies for each LULC categories. The result of the study landscape reveals that the ecosystem service values (ESVs) decreased by 25\% from US\$ 1.33 million to US\$ 1.07 million because of losing cropland and vegetation cover by 34\% and 35\% respectively during 1990–2017. In case of individual ecosystem service functions, regulating services increased by 12\% since 1990–2017 with highest contributing services of water regulation (57\%), water supply (22\%) and waste treatment (8\%) respectively while maximum decline is recorded in soil formation (33.33\%) followed by climatic regulation (31.82\%) and nutrient cycling (31.25\%). The decline in total and some individual ESV in the study landscape requires for urgent measures to be taken to enhance the urban ecosystem sustainability through effective planning and policies.},

However, decision-support tools able to consider multiple ecosystem services in the urban setting using complex and heterogeneous data are still in early development. Here, we use New York City (NYC) as a case study to evaluate and analyze how the value of multiple ecosystem services of urban green infrastructure shifts with shifting governance priorities. We first examined the spatial distribution of five ecosystem services – storm water absorption, carbon storage, air pollution removal, local climate regulation, and recreation – to create the first multiple ecosystem services evaluation of all green infrastructure in NYC. Then, combining an urban ecosystem services landscape approach with spatial multicriteria analysis weighting scenarios, we examine the distribution of these ecosystem services in the city. We contrast the current NYC policy preference – which is focused on heavy investment in stormwater absorption – with a valuation approach that also accounts for other ecosystem services. We find substantial differences in the spatial distribution of priority areas for green infrastructure for the valuation scenarios. Among the scenarios we examined for NYC, we find that a scenario in which only stormwater absorption is prioritized leads to the most unevenly distributed ES values. By contrast, we find least variation in ES values where stormwater absorption, local climate regulation, carbon storage, air pollution removal, and recreational potential are all weighted equally. We suggest that green infrastructure planning strategies should include all landscape components that contribute to the production of ecosystem services and consider how planning priority alternatives generate different ecosystem services values.},

The methodology used in this study was based on an existing potential ecosystem services mapping methodology and spatially explicit index using open access available spatial data. The spatiotemporal changes in the potential ecosystem services along the urban-rural gradient of Bornova district were assessed by global climate regulation (carbon storage), microclimate mitigation (Land Surface Temperature) and ecological integrity. The total vegetation cover in Bornova district increased from 18.41 \% to 27.95 \% to the last 28 years, particularly in peri-urban areas. Accordingly, two of the selected ecosystem services’ potential has increased throughout the district, except for ecological integrity. These changes were closely related to the deliberate efforts of the Bornova Municipal Council in increasing the amount of urban green and open spaces throughout the Bornova district in coordination with Izmir Metropolitan City Council’s commitment to build a healthy and climate friendly city in the near future.},

We evaluated the ES in Bogota and Santiago for a 30-year period. Using remote sensing data, models and census data we quantified carbon regulation, climate mitigation and recreation potential. We assessed ES provision changes and their spatio-temporal patterns using landscape metrics. Urban vegetation patterns differ between the two cities because of climate variability and greening policies. Bogota stored more carbon than Santiago given to climate effects, differences within city were the result of different policies and management. Climate mitigation showed similar behavior for both cities, influenced by global climate, densification and urban sprawling. Recreation potential increased in the inner-city and decrease at the outskirts, reflecting unplanned urban sprawling and increase population. Areas of high ecosystem services connected for Bogota and fragmented for Santiago. Bogota improved its environmental condition, as evaluated by ES provision, while Santiago worsens, even there was an increased in vegetation cover. Vegetation cover was not a sufficient indicator for ecosystem services and the distribution of it becomes highly relevant for informing mismatches between services and vegetation.},

	abstract = {Urban ecosystem service (UES) is becoming an influential concept to guide the planning, design, and management of urban landscapes towards urban sustainability. However, its use is hindered by definitional ambiguity, and the conceptual bases underpinning its application remain weak. This is exemplified by two different but equally valid interpretations of UES: “urban ecosystem services”, referring to ecosystem services from analogs of natural and semi-natural ecosystems within urban boundaries, and “urban ecosystem services”, a much broader term that includes the former group as well as urban services in a city. While we recognize that a single definition of UES is not possible nor necessary as its application is context-dependent, it is nevertheless useful to clarify the relationships between these interpretations to promote consistent use, and importantly, explore how a broader interpretation of UES might advance its applications in areas that have been neglected. We developed a conceptual framework that links UES to natural and human-derived capital to explain the relationships between the dual meanings of UES and proposed three normative propositions to guide its application: (1) integrate holistically multiple components of natural capital to provide UES, (2) reduce dependence on non-renewable abiotic resources and human-derived capital, and (3) enhance UES through technology. The framework we developed helps to resolve the current ambiguity in the meanings of UES, highlights the need to recognise neglected aspects of natural capital important for UES, and can be used to clarify relationships with related concepts conveying dependence of human well-being on nature.},

Although ES map quality has received some recent attention in the literature, little is known about the accuracy of these maps in urban contexts or about the factors that influence this accuracy. To address this issue, we quantitatively compared and validated ES maps in a heterogeneous urban landscape to generate insight into ES map accuracy in these environments. Using aboveground biomass carbon storage as an example, we examined how input data resolution and assessment method affect the accuracy of urban ES maps. Two mapping methods were employed: (1) maps based on ecosystem components involved in carbon storage (trees and lawns) and (2) maps based on land-cover proxies and data at coarse and fine spatial resolutions. We compared carbon storage predicted by these methods to that estimated by using field-collected data to examine the accuracy of predictions and spatial variation therein. Different methods and data produced similar study area-wide estimates; however, the spatial distribution of estimates varied among methods. Estimates using ecosystem components agreed with the actual observations better than the proxy-based estimates, although map accuracy was improved by using higher resolution land-cover data. Thus, when study area-wide estimates suffice for decision making, proxy-based methods and coarse-resolution data should provide adequate assessments. Detailed ecosystem structure and composition data are needed when fine-resolution, spatially-explicit estimates are required.},

However, the tree benefits in urban planning are insufficiently recognised, and there is little knowledge on the tree characteristics that are relevant to humans and how they are evaluated. This paper presents perceptual tree parameters and their relation to human preferences. In study 1, participants sorted 24 tree images by perceived similarity. Hierarchical cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling (MDS) revealed the distinction between conifers and deciduous trees, crown shape, the two-dimensional crown size to trunk height ratio and the crown density as important to humans. In study 2, participants rated the trees based on their preferences. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that a high two-dimensional crown size to trunk height ratio and a high crown density predicted deciduous tree preferences. These findings are discussed in light of the savannah hypothesis and the Gestalt grouping principle of closure. In the task of tree selection and placement for urban areas, the identified perceptual tree parameters may allow for achieving a coherent overall picture with a simultaneous increase of tree species richness. Thus, urban landscape planning can apply the presented findings for increasing ecosystem health and residential satisfaction.},

Though species richness is high in all the various land-uses, a few species are dominant accounting for {\textgreater}70\% of the tree density. Species richness is high in parks and residential areas. Tree density is high in parks, temples and around lakes, where the land-use is recreational and low in commercial and residential areas, which have high built-up area. Bangalore urban forest is still young with most of the trees (70\%), having {\textless}15cm in DBH. The larger trees are in older establishments of institutions, offices, commercial areas and parks. The Kolmogonov–Smirnov test shows that there is a variation in DBH distribution in old and new land-uses of institutions and temples. Among the tree owning households (50\%) in residential areas, 40\% of the houses have {\textgreater}5 trees and 22\% of houses have {\textgreater}5 tree species in their compound. Trees in residential areas were sampled and studied according to the economic strata of residents and the age of the area. One hundred and sixty-four species were identified in different residential areas, of which 149 species were recorded within compounds and 87 species were avenue trees. The species composition and cluster analysis showed that species choice varied in terms of the economic status of the communities rather than that with time.},

	abstract = {Urban forests can play an important role in mitigating the impacts of climate change by reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Quantification of carbon (C) storage and sequestration by urban forests is critical for the assessment of the actual and potential role of urban forests in reducing atmospheric CO2. This paper provides a case study of the quantification of C storage and sequestration by urban forests in Shenyang, a heavily industrialized city in northeastern China. The C storage and sequestration were estimated by biomass equations, using field survey data and urban forests data derived from high-resolution QuickBird images. The benefits of C storage and sequestration were estimated by monetary values, as well as the role of urban forests on offsetting C emissions from fossil fuel combustion. The results showed that the urban forests in areas within the third-ring road of Shenyang stored 337,000t C (RMB92.02 million, or \$ 13.88 million), with a C sequestration rate of 29,000t/yr (RMB7.88 million, or \$ 1.19 million). The C stored by urban forests equaled to 3.02\% of the annual C emissions from fossil fuel combustion, and C sequestration could offset 0.26\% of the annual C emissions in Shenyang. In addition, our results indicated that the C storage and sequestration rate varied among urban forest types with different species composition and age structure. These results can be used to help assess the actual and potential role of urban forests in reducing atmospheric CO2 in Shenyang. In addition, they provide insights for decision-makers and the public to better understand the role of urban forests, and make better management plans for urban forests.},

To what extent anthropogenic CO2 emissions generated from cities can be offset through conserving or increasing carbon (C) stored within urban areas themselves is a significant scientific question. The role of urban street trees in offsetting anthropogenic CO2 emissions still remains uncertain. Here, using data from field surveys, tree growth measurements and governmental statistical yearbooks, we estimated the C storage and C sequestration capacity of street trees in Beijing. Results showed that the C density and C sequestration rate in Beijing’s urban street trees were about 1/3 {\textasciitilde}1/2 of the corresponding magnitudes of non-urban forests in China. However, the total C sequestration of street trees in Beijing’s urban districts was 3.1±1.8 Gg C yr-1 (1 Gg = 109 g) in 2014, equivalent to only about 0.2\% of its annual CO2-equivalent emissions from total energy consumption, indicating a rather limited role in offsetting overall anthropogenic CO2 emissions.},

	abstract = {The present work, focusing on the theme of food production and consumption in urban areas, analyses the relationships among three factors: city, human well-being and ecosystems. A case study was carried out addressing the quantification of the potential of rooftop vegetable production in the city of Bologna (Italy) as related to its citizens’ needs. Besides the contribution to food security of the city, the potential benefits to urban biodiversity and ecosystem service provision were estimated. The methodology consisted of: 1) experimental trials of potential productivity of simplified soilless systems in rooftop gardens (RTGs); 2) detection of all flat roofs and roof-terraces and quantification of the potential surfaces that could be converted into RTGs; 3) identification of the city’s vegetable requirements, based on population and diet data; 4) calculation of the proportion of vegetable requirement that could be satisfied by local RTG production; 5) identification of other benefits (improvement of urban biodiversity through the creation of green corridors and estimation of carbon sequestration) associated with the increased area of urban green infrastructure (GI). According to the present study, RTGs could provide more than 12,000 t year−1 vegetables to Bologna, satisfying 77 \% of the inhabitants’ requirements. The study also advances hypotheses for the implementation of biodiversity roofs enabling the connection of biodiversity rich areas across and close to the city: these would form a network of green corridors of over 94 km length with a density of about 0.67 km km−2.},

	abstract = {Though urban agriculture (UA), defined here as growing of crops in cities, is increasing in popularity and importance globally, little is known about the aggregate benefits of such natural capital in built-up areas. Here, we introduce a quantitative framework to assess global aggregate ecosystem services from existing vegetation in cities and an intensive UA adoption scenario based on data-driven estimates of urban morphology and vacant land. We analyzed global population, urban, meteorological, terrain, and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) datasets in Google Earth Engine to derive global scale estimates, aggregated by country, of services provided by UA. We estimate the value of four ecosystem services provided by existing vegetation in urban areas to be on the order of \$33 billion annually. We project potential annual food production of 100–180 million tonnes, energy savings ranging from 14 to 15 billion kilowatt hours, nitrogen sequestration between 100,000 and 170,000 tonnes, and avoided storm water runoff between 45 and 57 billion cubic meters annually. In addition, we estimate that food production, nitrogen fixation, energy savings, pollination, climate regulation, soil formation and biological control of pests could be worth as much as \$80–160 billion annually in a scenario of intense UA implementation. Our results demonstrate significant country-to-country variability in UA-derived ecosystem services and reduction of food insecurity. These estimates represent the first effort to consistently quantify these incentives globally, and highlight the relative spatial importance of built environments to act as change agents that alleviate mounting concerns associated with global environmental change and unsustainable development.},

In a continental-scale analysis, incorporating 477 species and {\textgreater}5 000 000 bird observations, we developed a novel and scalable methodology that evaluated the ecological and life history traits which most influence a species’ adaptability to persist in urban environments. Specifically, we assigned species-specific scores based on continuous measures of response to urbanization, using VIIRS night-time light values (i.e. radiance) as a proxy for urbanization. We identified generalized, phylogenetically controlled patterns: bird species which are generalists (i.e. large niche breadth), with large clutch size, and large residual brain size are among the most urban-tolerant bird species. Conversely, specialized feeding strategies (i.e. insectivores and granivores) were negatively associated with urbanization. Enhancement and persistence of avian biodiversity in urban environments probably relies on protecting, maintaining and restoring diverse habitats serving a range of life history strategies.},

	abstract = {Within urban environment with high-rise buildings and structures, walls represent the most common vertical spaces. Conventionally, such spaces are viewed as abiotic areas, where spontaneous flora is neglected. Through investigations in a typical mountainous city Chongqing, this study concerns the spontaneous species diversity on walls and the influences of wall factors and the adjacent environment. A total of 239 vascular plant species belonging to 172 genera and 75 families were found; 90\% of the species are indigenous. More fern species inhabit walls, compared with xerophytes that dominate general urban environment. Variation partitioning indicated that wall attributes played a more important role in explaining the total variation in wall vegetation composition and structure than did the adjacent environment. Given that there are limited possibilities to extend more green space in urban land environment, we support a “let Nature take its course” approach to improve urban biodiversity, where vertical urban space with spontaneous flora can act as a valuable complement to biodiversity and ecosystem services in dense urban environment. This study should raise urban designers’ and ecosystem managers’ awareness of the possibilities of this type of informal, unconventional habitat as a “supplement” for urban greening and landscaping.},

	abstract = {Low-density rural home development is the fastest-growing form of land use in the United States since 1950. This “exurban” development (∼6–25 homes/km2) includes urban fringe development (UFD) on the periphery of cities and rural residential development (RRD) in rural areas attractive in natural amenities. This paper synthesizes current knowledge on the effects of UFD and RRD. We present two case studies and examine the patterns of biodiversity response and the ecological mechanisms that may underlie these responses. We found that many native species have reduced survival and reproduction near homes, and native species richness often drops with increased exurban densities. Exotic species, some human-adapted native species, and species from early successional stages often increase with exurban development. These relationships are sometimes nonlinear, with sharp thresholds in biodiversity response. These effects may be manifest for several decades following exurban development, so that biodiversity is likely still responding to the wave of exurban expansion that has occurred since 1950. The location of exurban development is often nonrandom relative to biodiversity because both are influenced by biophysical factors. Consequently, the effects on biodiversity may be disproportionately large relative to the area of exurban development. RRD is more likely than UFD to occur near public lands; hence it may have a larger influence on nature reserves and wilderness species. The ecological mechanisms that may underlie these responses involve alteration of habitat, ecological processes, biotic interactions, and increased human disturbance. Research on the patterns and mechanisms of biodiversity remains underdeveloped, and comparative and experimental studies are needed. Knowledge resulting from such studies will increase our ability to understand, manage, and mitigate negative impacts on biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Aim We assessed the independent and interactive effects of land use and other factors on regional distributions of lake shore bird assemblages. Location Analyses were restricted to lakes of the northeastern United States (New England, New York, New Jersey). Methods Lake shore bird and habitat data were collected from a regional sample of 186 lakes between 1991 and 1995. Local and regional gradients in environmental attributes of the lakes and their watersheds, and in bird species composition, were characterized using detrended correspondence analysis. Bird assemblages were also characterized with respect to species diversity, total bird abundance, and absolute and proportional abundance for neotropical migrants, omnivores and tree foragers. The assemblage measures were compared with the environmental gradients and with the environmental variables from which those gradients were derived using correlations, linear regression and bivariate plots. Results Anthropogenic variables (e.g. human density) and nonanthropogenic variables (e.g. climate, forest composition, lake productivity) were highly confounded regionally, reflecting the influence of climate and geomorphology on land use and, in turn, the influence of land use on the environment. Moving south along the regional gradient to watersheds with more intensive land use, changes in bird assemblage structure were consistent with anthropogenic effects on the avifauna attributable to forest fragmentation: total bird abundance increased, fragmentation-tolerant species were encountered more frequently, the proportional abundance of omnivores increased and the proportional abundances of tree foragers and neotropical migrants decreased. Bird diversity, as assayed using rarefaction, peaked at an intermediate position along the regional gradient, as did the absolute abundances of tree foragers and migrants. Main conclusions We propose that some community attributes peaked at an intermediate position along the regional gradient as a result of the interactive effects of land use and other factors on this region’s avifauna, with broad-scale anthropogenic factors constraining assemblages on the urbanized lakes, and climate or other nonanthropogenic factors constraining assemblages on the pristine lakes. Anthropogenic and nonanthropogenic factors of similar scale and magnitude thus acted in concert to shape regional bird distributions.},

	abstract = {The term beta diversity has been used to refer to a wide variety of phenomena. Although all of these encompass some kind of compositional heterogeneity between places, many are not related to each other in any predictable way. The present two-part review aims to put the different phenomena that have been called a beta component of diversity into a common conceptual framework, and to explain what each of them measures. In this first part, the focus is on defining beta diversity. This involves deciding what diversity is and how the observed total or gamma diversity (γ) is partitioned into alpha (α) and beta (β) components. Several different definitions of “beta diversity” that result from these decisions have been used in the ecological literature. True beta diversity is obtained when the total effective number of species in a dataset (true gamma diversityγ) is multiplicatively partitioned into the effective number of species per compositionally distinct virtual sampling unit (true alpha diversityαd) and the effective number of such compositional units (βMd=γ/αd). All true diversities quantify the effective number of types of entities. Because the other variants of “beta diversity” that have been used by ecologists quantify other phenomena, an alternative nomenclature is proposed here for the seven most popular beta components: regional-to-local diversity ratio, two-way diversity ratio, absolute effective species turnover (=regional diversity excess), Whittaker's effective species turnover, proportional effective species turnover, regional entropy excess and regional variance excess. In the second part of the review, the focus will be on how to quantify these phenomena in practice. This involves deciding how the sampling units that contribute to total diversity are selected, and whether the entity that is quantified is all of “beta diversity”, a specific part of “beta diversity”, the rate of change in “beta diversity” in relation to a given external factor, or something else.},

	abstract = {Estimates of biodiversity change are essential for the management and conservation of ecosystems. Accurate estimates rely on selecting representative sites, but monitoring often focuses on sites of special interest. How such site-selection biases influence estimates of biodiversity change is largely unknown. Site-selection bias potentially occurs across four major sources of biodiversity data, decreasing in likelihood from citizen science, museums, national park monitoring, and academic research. We defined site-selection bias as a preference for sites that are either densely populated (i.e., abundance bias) or species rich (i.e., richness bias). We simulated biodiversity change in a virtual landscape and tracked the observed biodiversity at a sampled site. The site was selected either randomly or with a site-selection bias. We used a simple spatially resolved, individual-based model to predict the movement or dispersal of individuals in and out of the chosen sampling site. Site-selection bias exaggerated estimates of biodiversity loss in sites selected with a bias by on average 300–400\% compared with randomly selected sites. Based on our simulations, site-selection bias resulted in positive trends being estimated as negative trends: richness increase was estimated as 0.1 in randomly selected sites, whereas sites selected with a bias showed a richness change of −0.1 to −0.2 on average. Thus, site-selection bias may falsely indicate decreases in biodiversity. We varied sampling design and characteristics of the species and found that site-selection biases were strongest in short time series, for small grains, organisms with low dispersal ability, large regional species pools, and strong spatial aggregation. Based on these findings, to minimize site-selection bias, we recommend use of systematic site-selection schemes; maximizing sampling area; calculating biodiversity measures cumulatively across plots; and use of biodiversity measures that are less sensitive to rare species, such as the effective number of species. Awareness of the potential impact of site-selection bias is needed for biodiversity monitoring, the design of new studies on biodiversity change, and the interpretation of existing data.},

The populations and economies of urban areas rely on hinterlands for resources, but there is a disconnect between using resources for the city on the one hand and preserving or conserving ecosystem services that are outside of the city on the other (Chaps. 2 and 3). While it is recognized that cities and their urban dwellers will need to begin to take greater responsibility for stewardship of Earth’s resources (Seitzinger et al. 2012), urban sustainability efforts often are prone to localism, thus failing to take into account the need to conserve resources elsewhere (Seto et al. 2012a).},

We demonstrate its application by assessing the impact of rapid urbanization in the Guangzhou-Foshan Metropolitan Area (GFMA) in southern China from 1990 to 2010. Supply and demand curves were developed for both private-good and public-good ecosystem services based on published price elasticities. Change in ecosystem services supply was calculated using a well-established unit-value transfer method and change in demand was calculated as a function of population, wealth, and income elasticity. Naïve assessment (i.e. ignoring supply and demand effects on scarcity value) found a small (−4.4\%) decrease in the value of physical supply of ecosystem services from US\$4.631 billion in 1990 to US\$4.430 billion in 2010. When the effects of changes in supply and demand were considered, the scarcity value of ecosystem services increased dramatically to US\$33.774 billion (+629\%) in 2010 driven by a strong increase in demand especially for public-good type services with poor substitutes, combined with a slightly reduced supply. A renewed focus on land-use planning is urgently required to ensure the sustainability of increasingly valuable ecosystem services for the wellbeing of burgeoning urban populations.},

	abstract = {The San Antonio River Basin (SARB) is an ecologically diverse region in South Texas. The city of San Antonio is located within the basin and is the hub of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). San Antonio, together with other major metropolitan centers in Texas, has experienced rapid population and economic growth over the last thirty years, which accelerated after the implementation of NAFTA in 1994. To assess the environmental implications of this growth in the SARB, we first conducted a land-change analysis using Landsat images from 1984, 1995, and 2010. Then, we analyzed spatiotemporal changes in ecosystem services across the SARB and within three watersheds in Bexar County where the city of San Antonio is located. To estimate changes in ecosystem service values (ESV) during this period, we combined the results of the land-change analysis with a benefit transfer approach using two sets of widely cited ecosystem-service valuation coefficients published in 1997 and 2014 but we modified the urban coefficient from the 2014 publication for low-density and high-density urban areas. When 1997 coefficients were applied, the ESV in the SARB decreased, on average, by \$1.2million/year during 1984–1995 and by \$1.8million/year during 1995–2010. The ESV in Bexar County decreased, on average, by \$0.5million/year and \$0.7million/year during the first and second periods, respectively. When the 2014 coefficients and modified urban value coefficients were applied, the ESV in the SARB decreased, on average, by a 27\% more during the first period than when the 1997 coefficients were applied, while, ESV increased during the second period by an average of \$2.2million/year. This temporally opposite trend in ESV change did not occur in Bexar County, however. Using the 2014 coefficients, ESV in Bexar County decreased 5 times more during the first period and decreased 2.5 times more during the second period than when 1997 coefficients were applied. The differences in ESV trends resulting from the two sets of coefficients can be explained primarily by the different coefficients assigned to urban spaces (\$0/ha/year in the 1997 study and \$7005/ha/year in the 2014 study). Our results suggest that the value placed on urban areas in the 2014 publication, taken from a single case study and intended primarily for large urban parks, substantially overestimates the ESV of urban space. In our study areas, applying this value, even only to urban green space, led to the improbable conclusion that urbanization had a positive overall effect on the delivery of ecosystem services. While open spaces in urban areas do provide valuable ecosystem services, it is highly unlikely that their value exceeds those provided by less modified ecosystems. The ability to confidently use value coefficients when applying benefit transfer methods to estimate ESVs demands rigorous assessments of their broad applicability.},

In this paper, we provide an updated estimate based on updated unit ecosystem service values and land use change estimates between 1997 and 2011. We also address some of the critiques of the 1997 paper. Using the same methods as in the 1997 paper but with updated data, the estimate for the total global ecosystem services in 2011 is \$125trillion/yr (assuming updated unit values and changes to biome areas) and \$145trillion/yr (assuming only unit values changed), both in 2007 \$US. From this we estimated the loss of eco-services from 1997 to 2011 due to land use change at \$4.3–20.2trillion/yr, depending on which unit values are used. Global estimates expressed in monetary accounting units, such as this, are useful to highlight the magnitude of eco-services, but have no specific decision-making context. However, the underlying data and models can be applied at multiple scales to assess changes resulting from various scenarios and policies. We emphasize that valuation of eco-services (in whatever units) is not the same as commodification or privatization. Many eco-services are best considered public goods or common pool resources, so conventional markets are often not the best institutional frameworks to manage them. However, these services must be (and are being) valued, and we need new, common asset institutions to better take these values into account.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity provides many ecosystem services in cities that are beneficial to human well-being including adaptation to the effects of climate change and positive effects of nature on human health. Rapid urbanization however is causing an adverse impact on biodiversity and the ecosystem services they provide. Protecting and restoring urban biodiversity and ecosystem services can increase human well-being of the rapidly increasing urban population. Today, however, the international biodiversity conservation practice mainly focuses on rural areas, and not on urban conservation and restoration. Within city scale, there are several opportunities to green urban living, such as green infrastructure and urban parks and nature reserves. This paper investigates the current scientific practices for promoting and protecting ecosystem services in urban areas. Secondly, the authors review and assess the legally binding instruments on biodiversity at the international and EU level in order to see if there are sufficient existing mechanisms for protection of ecosystem services in urban areas. Thirdly, the paper elaborates on the Aichi Targets in order to explore whether or not these targets are enough to facilitate the protection and enhancement of ecosystem services in urban areas as swiftly as they are needed.},

	abstract = {The concept of ecosystem services has shifted our paradigm of how nature matters to human societies. Instead of viewing the preservation of nature as something for which we have to sacrifice our well-being, we now perceive the environment as natural capital, one of society's important assets. But ecosystem services are becoming increasingly scarce. In order to stop this trend, the challenge is to provoke society to acknowledge the value of natural capital. Ecosystem services valuation (ESV) is the method to tackle such a challenge. ESV is the process of assessing the contributions of ecosystem services to sustainable scale, fair distribution, and efficient allocation. It is a tool that (1) provides for comparisons of natural capital to physical and human capital in regard to their contributions to human welfare; (2) monitors the quantity and quality of natural capital over time with respect to its contribution to human welfare; and (3) provides for evaluation of projects that will affect natural capital stocks. This review covers: (1) what has been done in ESV research in the last 50 years; (2) how it has been used in ecosystem management; and (3) prospects for the future. Our survey of the literature has shown that over time, there has been movement toward a more transdisciplinary approach to ESV research which is more consistent with the nature of the problems being addressed. On the other hand, the contribution of ESV to ecosystem management has not been as significant as hoped nor as clearly defined. Conclusions drawn from the review are as follows: first, ESV researchers will have to transcend disciplinary boundaries and synthesize tools, skills, and methodologies from various disciplines; second, ESV research has to become more problem-driven rather than tool-driven because ultimately the success of ESV will be judged on how well it facilitates real-world decision making and the conservation of natural capital.},

The results indicated that (1) a total ESV of 5.63 trillion US dollars annually was provided, of which forests provided the highest proportion (46.0\%), and the regulating services had the highest contribution among the four categories of services (71.3\%); (2) the total ESV from 11 categories showed apparent seasonal variation, with higher values from May to September than from November to February which contributed 76.9\% and 7.4\% to total ESV, respectively; (3) the highest ESV per unit area mainly distributed in southern and eastern areas, and the value generally decreased from southeast to northwest; and (4) the ratio of ESV per capita to the gloss domestic product (GDP) per capita was about 0.87, and such ratio was lowest in the most economically developed and densely populated areas. Therefore, the dynamic assessment method developed in this study can provide a scientific basis for Chinese policy decision-making.},

	abstract = {Increasing human activities worldwide have significantly altered the natural ecosystems and consequently, the services they provide. This is no exception in Nigeria, where land-use/land-cover has undergone a series of dramatic changes over the years mainly due to the ever-growing large population. However, estimating the impact of such changes on a wide range of ecosystem services is seldom attempted. Thus, on the basis of GlobeLand30 land-cover maps for 2000 and 2010 and using the value transfer methodology, we evaluated changes in the value of ecosystem services in response to land-use/land-cover dynamics in Nigeria. The results showed that over the 10-year period, cultivated land sprawl over the forests and savannahs was predominant, and occurred mainly in the northern region of the country. During this period, we calculated an increase in the total ecosystem services value (ESV) in Nigeria from 665.93 billion (2007 US\$) in 2000 to 667.44 billion (2007 US\$) in 2010, 97.38\% of which was contributed by cultivated land. The value of provisioning services increased while regulation, support, recreation and culture services decreased, amongst which, water regulation (−11.01\%), gas regulation (−7.13\%), cultural (−4.84\%) and climate regulation (−4.3\%) ecosystem functions are estimated as the most impacted. The increase in the total ESV in Nigeria associated with the huge increase in ecosystem services due to cultivated land expansion may make land-use changes (i.e. the ever-increasing agricultural expansion in Nigeria) appear economically profitable. However, continuous loss of services such as climate and water regulation that are largely provided by the natural ecosystems can result in huge economic losses that may exceed the apparent gains from cultivated land development. Therefore, we advocate that the conservation of the natural ecosystem should be a priority in future land-use management in Nigeria, a country highly vulnerable to climate change and incessantly impacted by natural disasters such as flooding.},

To use these services, municipalities have focused efforts on designing and implementing ecosystem-services-based “green infrastructure” in urban environments. In some cases the environmental benefits of this infrastructure have been well documented, but they are often unclear, unquantified, and/or outweighed by potential costs. Quantifying biogeochemical processes in urban green infrastructure can improve our understanding of urban ecosystem services and disservices (negative or unintended consequences) resulting from designed urban green spaces. Here we propose a framework to integrate biogeochemical processes into designing, implementing, and evaluating the net effectiveness of green infrastructure, and provide examples for GHG mitigation, stormwater runoff mitigation, and improvements in air quality and health.},

Initially, most studies on ecosystem services assessments addressed global, sub-global or local levels. More recently, development of ecosystem services assessments at national level has been emphasized. Following this trend, integrated assessment of ecosystem services has been performed in the Czech Republic. Our study aimed to identify and value ecosystem services delivered in the Czech Republic. To estimate the total value of Czech ecosystems, we developed a geographically-specific database of ecosystem service values. The structure of the assessment is given by six ecosystem types (agricultural ecosystems, grasslands, forests, aquatic ecosystems, wetlands and urban areas) and 17 ecosystem services delivered from these ecosystems. Ecosystem types are further classified into 41 ecosystem categories based on a habitat approach. Specific literature review strategy was conducted to fill the database with biophysical and economic values of ecosystem services. Developed database consists of more than 190 values of ecosystem services, approximately half of them has been used for a benefit transfer to calculate total ecosystem values in the Czech Republic. The resulting average value of ecosystem services in the Czech Republic represents 1.5 the current national GNP (gross national product).},

	abstract = {Many aspects of global change, including carbon dioxide emissions, have been attributed to urban areas. On the other hand, cities have been found to provide valuable ecosystem services such as carbon storage. The aim of this study is to estimate the above-ground carbon storage in trees in the central European city of Leipzig and produce spatially explicit carbon storage maps. We used stratified random sampling across 19 land cover classes using 190 sample plots to measure carbon storage. In addition, we derived canopy cover from color-infrared orthophotos using an object-oriented approach and Random Forest machine learning. Finally, we apply an error assessment method that includes sampling error, but also uncertainty stemming from allometric equations, and that so far has only been applied to rural forests. The total above ground carbon stock of Leipzig was estimated using both land cover and canopy cover, which was more laborious than just using land cover but reduced the standard error. Canopy cover was approximately 19\% of the city area. Leipzig's above-ground carbon storage was estimated to be 316,000MgC at 11MgCha−1. The distribution of carbon storage across the city showed the highest values at intermediate urbanization levels. Carbon storage in the city of Leipzig was in the lower range compared to cities in Europe, Asia and the USA, and our results indicate that great care should be taken when transferring values between cities. We provide spatially explicit and detailed maps of above-ground storage that can contribute to ecosystem services assessments.},

	abstract = {The transition of the ecosystem service framework from academic discourse into practical land use management and policy guidance is in the making. Planners and decision makers seek spatial valuation data, comprehensive examples of which are few or hindered by sectoral research traditions. We present a case of linking land use to multimethod spatial ecosystem service valuation aiming at comprehensiveness and commensurability, based on a project run parallel to regional land-use planning in the Tampere region, Finland. A spectrum of ecosystem services was scrutinized, the annual value of which was estimated at €0.8–1B. Compared to land-use planning, core areas of ecological networks proved relatively poor in terms of valuation, but hot-spots of human–nature interaction such as recreational, groundwater and landscape areas immensely valuable. Strong urban-rural trends in ecosystem service value were found, emphasizing the importance of urban nature and the context-specificity of natural capital discourse. We argue that some mismatches exist between the ecosystem service framework and its practical applicability, and that the main problem is not necessarily the transferability of tools and indicators, but the transfer of valuation and the assumptions and choices behind it. Notwithstanding its problems, the applied framework proved valuable in evaluating and guiding future land use.},

Hence, the inclusion of ecosystem services in planning is essential to promote sustainable urban development. This article investigates to what extent ecosystem services are currently included in urban plans. The ultimate objective is to understand what ecosystem service information is already used, and what is still needed to improve planning decisions. We developed a methodology to review the content of planning documents irrespective of the terminology adopted to refer to ecosystem services, and examined the inclusion of nine urban ecosystem services across three plan components. In our sample of 22 urban plans of Italian cities, we found a high number of actions to address urban ecosystem services and a variety of tools for implementation. However, a two-speed integration emerges: a set of ecosystem services (i.e. recreation and some regulating services linked to typical urban environmental problems) are widely addressed, while others are hardly considered. Shortcomings can be partly ascribed to gaps in the scientific literature. Usable methods to assess urban ecosystem services at the right scale and resolution while also accounting for the multi-functionality of urban green infrastructures are still needed. On the other hand, future urban plans would benefit from a further appropriation of the ecosystem service approach by practitioners and decision-makers. Acknowledging the whole range of urban ecosystem services, defining strategic objectives related to their provision, and explicitly identifying demand and beneficiaries could increase awareness of the values at stake, ensure long-term commitment in the implementation phase, and strengthen planning arguments against conflicting interests.},

However, methods to value both demand and supply and to balance them on a fine scale are still lacking. The study presents a scheme to assess demand and supply of UES and derive respective budgets by using detailed environmental, urban structural and socio-economic data. We show heterogeneous demand and supply patterns for five highly relevant UES on the block, neighborhood and entire city scale in Berlin, Germany. We detect the most negative budgets along major city highways and in the most compact city structures, which calls for new and creative ways to introduce green and tackle high sealing rates especially in these areas. Due to the above-average green amount in Berlin the UES green space recreation and PM 10 removal showed to be unusually well balanced. The method is able to close a gap in methods for UES demand valuation and consequently develops a transferable methodology for informed planning processes. Furthermore we argue for the usability in planning processes due to its applicability on any relevant scale.},

Focusing on allotment gardens, this study quantitatively analyzed their economic conditions, ecosystem service provisions, economic and environmental efficiencies, and the differences among them as regards their location and management. A questionnaire survey was used for data collection as a basic input for the quantification of economic conditions and ecosystem services of 223 allotments in Saitama Prefecture, Japan. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used for analyzing the economic and environmental efficiency of each allotment. Statistical analyses were conducted to explore statistically significant differences in economic conditions, ecosystem service provisions, and economic and environmental efficiencies among the four groups of allotment gardens classified by location (i.e., urbanization promotion area [UPA] and urbanization control area [UCA]) and type of actor (i.e., public or private). Our analysis identified that the expenditures of public allotments tended to be significantly larger than those of private allotments, whereas there was no difference in the income among the four groups, which resulted in lower economic efficiency of public allotments. Moreover, although public allotments in UCA and UPA provided a large amount of food production, recreation, and disaster prevention services, DEA revealed that they were less environmentally efficient when expenditures such as land rent, construction cost, and operational cost were considered. Our findings also identified that public allotments provided a significantly large amount of ecosystem services for urban dwellers in exchange of large public expenditures, which often resulted in inefficient allotment operation. If local governments and private actors build a collaborative relationship and strategically divide their roles, the governments could decrease the financial burden in the establishment and operations of allotments while maintaining/increasing benefits arising from allotment gardens.},

Facing several barriers on the use of scenarios, however, a participatory scenario approach has gained wider attention in place-based environmental research communities. In this paper, we investigate future ecosystem services (i.e., food production, carbon sequestration, nutrient retention, and habitat provision) in the explorative manner in the Sado island, Japan, using a participatory scenario approach and spatial ecological–economic modelling techniques. The contributions of this paper to the existing literatures are twofold: the one is collaborative use of morphological analysis and participants’ votes for more fair and transparent scenario building, and the other is a suite of spatial modelling techniques, inter alia, land-use projections using a spatial multinomial logit model, for more robust and accurate simulations. Taking such innovative approaches and constructing the ecosystem service index reflecting local perceptions, we built distinctive six scenarios and projected future ecosystem services. As consequences, we could (1) illuminate the trade-offs between land-based ecosystem services, (2) highlight the importance of adequate mosaic structures in providing bundle of ecosystem services, and (3) visualize the spatially heterogenous impacts of alternative scenarios that imply one scenario does not fit all areas. We also discussed the interpretation of a sink service from sustainability perspectives and lessons learned from the parallel approach of participatory scenario building and quantitative modelling exercises.},

	abstract = {Tree growth equations are indispensable for modeling tree functions for ecosystem services. However, knowledge about the growth rates of street trees in Japan remains limited. This study aimed to examine the growth characteristics of street trees (Zelkova serrata, Platanus orientalis, and Prunus yedoensis) in Japan to generate growth equations of the diameter at breast height (DBH) based on measurements of tree rings. Specifically, diameter growth was used and compared against nursery-grown trees used in previous studies in Japan and street trees in the USA. The diameter growth rate per year of Z. serrata ranged from 0.43 cm to 1.12 cm, with peak growth occurring at 17.8 years of age. For P. orientalis, the diameter growth rate per year ranged from 0.25 cm to 1.59 cm, with peak growth occurring at 7.4 years of age. For P. yedoensis, the diameter growth rate per year ranged from 0.68 cm to 1.65 cm, with no apparent peak growth. The Chapman-Richards growth function generated the best fit as a diameter growth equation for all three species out of three tested theoretical growth equations (Chapman-Richards, Gompertz, and Logistic function). For 25-year old trees, the estimated DBH of Z. serrata and P. orientalis grown as street trees was 68 \% and 84 \% of that of nursery-grown trees, respectively. For street trees 25 years after planting, the estimated DBH of Z. serrata, P. orientalis, and P. yedoensis in Kyoto City was 62 \%, 63 \%, and 56 \% of that of street trees in the USA. The diameter growth of street trees in Kyoto was substantially lower than that of nursery-grown trees and street trees in the USA. Therefore, region-specific growth equations must be developed for street trees when the planting environment and management approaches are different.},

Understanding factors that encourage the spread of gardening within cities may help planners facilitate healthier and more biodiverse urban communities. This study characterizes the spatial distribution and attributes of gardens found in easement areas of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Spatial analyses of these privately managed public spaces provide evidence of clustering for both presence of gardens and their esthetic quality. Data collected on the location and attributes of easements from 22,562 properties during summer of 2009, show that 11\% of these properties held an easement garden. Results of multiple spatial analyses, each targeting a different aspect of garden distribution, show that (a) the most intense easement garden clustering occurs among neighbors with direct visual access to nearest neighbors’ easement areas; (b) it is 2.4 times as likely that a property holds an easement garden if a property within 30m holds one; (c) although clustering is measureable for all neighborhood sizes up to 610m from home, peak clustering happens within 91m of home; and (d) clustering of easement gardens are clustered in terms of quality (appeal), and greatest clustering occurs between pairs of adjacent neighbors. While larger scale factors may play a role in where a garden cluster is initiated, the dominant occurrence of relatively small cluster sizes indicates that social contagion is in play. The potential value of social contagion is discussed as a mechanism for spread sustainable behaviors that support ecological resilience in urban areas.},

The software evaluates the benefits of trees and other landscape features for energy use, stormwater runoff, air pollution, carbon sequestration, and wildlife habitat. While many examples are available of the use of CITYgreen in suburban morphologies, we set out to evaluate the applicability of CITYgreen for assessing these effects in a densely populated urban neighborhood. We inventoried 146 acres of urban land uses (commercial, residential, and institutional) in a Los Angeles neighborhood. CITYgreen does not calculate energy savings for structures larger than single-family residences, reducing its utility in densely built urban environments. The stormwater runoff reduction module works well when the field data themes were clipped so that the highest canopy (i.e., trees, shrubs, grass, or impermeable surface but no combination thereof) was recorded in every part of the study area. Carbon sequestration and air pollution removal modules worked well, but do not incorporate the best available science. Wildlife analysis falls short of its potential, given the extensive field data collected to use the program.},

	abstract = {Evenness indices are numerous but the lack of knowledge of their properties is a limitation to their biological usefulness. 15 evenness indices, two of them being recently proposed, were studied in this work. We investigated the sensitivity of each index using (1) 189 macroinvertebrate communities sampled in the field, and (2) a set of communities modified in a controlled way. There is no single way to measure evenness. We demonstrated that a measure should be chosen considering (1) the kind of data analysed and, (2) the index properties wanted by users. Depending on the ecological data set the index should be more sensitive to variations in rare, median or abundant species. For most of macroinvertebrate community analyses, a convenient evenness index requirs to be symmetric, unsensitive to variation on rare taxa, with a large range of variation and can be compared with a diversity index. Depending on diversity measure used, five indices correspond to these criteria: EPielou, EHurlbert, E–ln(D), E1–D, EMI. Our results were summarized in a table which may help users to select a convenient evenness measure according to their specific data. Concerning index properties, three main features that an evenness index should meet are briefly discussed: dependence with richness, symmetry criteria and variation range. A revue of this controversial subject allowed a best understanding of values obtained with evenness measures depending on their own features.},

	abstract = {Problem: Global warming has emerged as one of the new century's top planning challenges. But it is far from clear how state and local governments in the United States can best address climate change through planning. Purpose: As of 2008, 29 states had prepared some sort of climate change plan, and more than 170 local governments had joined the Cities for Climate Protection (CCP) campaign that requires that a plan be developed. This article analyzes this first generation of climate change plans and seeks to assess the goals being set, the measures included or left out, issues surrounding implementation, and the basic strengths and weaknesses of state and local climate change planning to date. Methods: I conducted this research by analyzing planning documents as well as interviewing state and local officials by telephone. I analyzed the plans of three types of governments: all states with planning documents on climate change; cities with populations of over 500,000 that are members of the CCP campaign; and selected smaller cities that are CCP members. Results and conclusions: Most plans set emissions-reduction goals, establish emission inventories, green public sector operations, and recommend a range of other measures. Many recent plans have been developed through extensive stakeholder processes and present very detailed lists of recommendations with quantified emissions benefits. But emissions-reduction goals vary widely, many proposed actions are voluntary, few resources have been allocated, and implementation of most measures has not yet taken place. Most plans do not address adaptation to a changing climate. Officials see rapidly growing public awareness of the issue and general support for climate change planning, but reluctance to change personal behavior. Takeaway for practice: Future climate change planning should (a) set goals that can adequately address the problem; (b) establish long-term planning frameworks in which progress toward these goals can be monitored on a regular basis and actions revised as needed; (c) include the full range of measures needed to reduce and adapt to climate change; (d) ensure implementation of recommended actions through commitment of resources, revised regulation, incentives for reducing emissions, and other means; and (e) develop strategies to deepen public awareness of the need for fundamental changes in behavior, for example regarding motor vehicle use. Research support: This research was supported by the University of California, Davis Department of Environmental Design.},

	abstract = {Problem: Cities play a fundamental role in the production of greenhouse gases and, as a result, are places where proactive mitigation and adaptation can occur. While increasing numbers of municipalities have revised or developed climate action plans (CAPs), our understanding of the impetus to plan for the climate challenge, processes for creating climate plans, and their resultant form remains limited. Purpose: We analyzed municipal CAPs to understand both their processes and their products, including the extent to which they represent innovation in planning. We ask the following questions: 1) Why do localities decide to undertake climate action planning, and what are the plans’ chief drivers and obstacles? 2) How have localities structured their climate action planning processes? 3) How frequently are particular types of actions included in local CAPs, and how do localities determine which to adopt? Methods: We read and evaluated the content of 20 CAPs from municipalities of a range of sizes and locations using a scoring matrix, reconciling coding differences. We also interviewed 16 individuals associated with 15 of the plans and coded notes from these interviews to identify themes relevant to the processes of plan development. Results and conclusions: There is great diversity in what constitutes a CAP. Some plans are motivational documents, while others are extremely detailed implementation plans with concrete goals, clear objectives, and well-reasoned methods. The decision to prepare a CAP reflects the existence of local political will and leadership, which also influences the planning processes used, the form of the resultant plan, and the actions it identifies. We found CAPs to rely heavily on well-known land use and transportation solutions to the climate challenge such as enhanced transit, compact community design, and green building codes, to be implemented both by local government and the broader community. Informants reported that their CAPs favored actions that were highly visible (e.g., tree planting) or produced immediate results (e.g., energy or cost savings from weatherization). Takeaway for practice: The CAPs we studied were special-purpose plans, and planning departments and planning commissions were not central to plan development in the majority of cases reviewed here. We advise professional planners to involve themselves more in CAP processes. Research support: We obtained funding for this project through a faculty enhancement grant from Portland State University.},

While many municipal and state governments have developed climate action plans designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, rising concentrations of greenhouse gases typically are not the strongest driver of warming in cities. Our purpose is to evaluate the likely effectiveness of municipal and state level climate action plans in slowing the pace of warming in the most populous U.S. cities over the near-to-medium term. We employ time-series temperature trend analyses to differentiate global from local-scale climate change mechanisms in large U.S. cities between 1961 and 2010. We then review all climate action plans developed at the municipal or state level in the 50 most populous metropolitan regions to identify the various emissions control and heat management strategies incorporated into these plans. The results of our assessment suggest that the climate change management policies adopted through municipal and state climate action plans may fail to adequately protect human health and welfare from rapidly rising temperatures. Based on our review, we recommend that municipal and state governments broaden climate action plans to include heat management strategies in addition to greenhouse gas emissions controls.},

While they were aware of expected climate change impacts, their capacity to use this information to develop geographically specific action plans was limited.

We also discuss key structural, procedural and contextual limitations that emerged from our evaluation of Southeast local governments, and provide recommendations to improve the development of the next generation of local climate adaptation plans.},

We compared vegetation and tree metrics such as structure diversity, and soil chemistry among colony islands, uninhabited islands, and abandoned colony islands within Guntersville Reservoir, a temperate forest ecosystem. Avian diversity and community structure were also quantified on these islands. Concentrations of potassium (K), phosphorus (P) and nitrate (NO3−) in soil were negatively related to cormorant use, while tree diversity was lower on historic (tree mean = 4.35 ± 2.46 species) and colony (tree mean = 3.91 ± 3.12 species) islands relative to reference islands (tree mean = 9.11 ± 3.88 species). Canopy cover was less (min: {\textless}20\%), and midstories denser on colony and historic islands relative to reference islands. Avian diversity was significantly lower for colony islands (mean = 6 ± 3 species) than both reference (11 ± 7 species) and historic (10 ± 7 species) islands. These effects of cormorant nesting can be seen even after 10 years of colony abandonment supporting that cormorants can have long-term effects on insular habitats in temperate forest ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Many social scientists recognize that quantitative text analysis is a useful research methodology, but its application is still concentrated in documents written in European languages, especially English, and few sub-fields of political science, such as comparative politics and legislative studies. This seems to be due to the absence of flexible and cost-efficient methods that can be used to analyze documents in different domains and languages. Aiming to solve this problem, this paper proposes a semisupervised document scaling technique, called Latent Semantic Scaling (LSS), which can locate documents on various pre-defined dimensions. LSS achieves this by combining user-provided seed words and latent semantic analysis (word embedding). The article demonstrates its flexibility and efficiency in large-scale sentiment analysis of New York Times articles on the economy and Asahi Shimbun articles on politics. These examples show that LSS can produce results comparable to that of the Lexicoder Sentiment Dictionary (LSD) in both English and Japanese with only small sets of sentiment seed words. A new heuristic method that assists LSS users to choose a near-optimal number of singular values to obtain word vectors that best capture differences between documents on target dimensions is also presented.},

	abstract = {Street trees are integral components of urban green infrastructure. The importance of benefits provided by street trees has motivated the development of various tools to quantify the value of ecosystem services. The i-Tree Eco is a widely applied method for quantifying urban forest structure, ecosystem services, and values. Since its first release in 2006, i-Tree Eco has been successfully utilized in over 100 countries around the world. This study described one of the first applications of the i-Tree Eco international project in Kyoto, Japan, by customizing the models and parameters to enhance the accuracy of analysis results. Kyoto’s street trees are prominently dominated by Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba L.), Trident Maple (Acer buergerianum Miq.), Japanese Zelkova (Zelkova serrata (Thunb.) Makino.), Tuliptree (Liriodendron tulipifera L.), Flowering dogwood (Cornus florida L.), London Planetree (Platanus × acerifolia), Plum/cherry (Prunus spp.), and Weeping willow (Salix babylonica), which account for 92\% of the 1230 sample trees and deliver ecosystem service benefits at US\$71,434.21 annually or US\$58.07/tree/year. The annual value of each function was estimated at US\$41.34/tree for carbon storage and sequestration, US\$3.26/tree for stormwater runoff reduction, US\$11.80/tree for adverse health mitigation effects, and US\$1.67/tree for energy savings. The street tree species of Kyoto city that produce the highest average annual benefits are among the largest trees currently in the population, including P. × yedoensis (US\$225.32/tree), Z. serrata (US\$123.21/tree), S. babylonica (US\$80.10/tree), and P. × acerifolia (US\$65.88/tree). Our results demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of street trees benefits for Kyoto city, providing baseline information for decision-makers and managers to make effective urban trees management decisions, developing policy, and setting priorities.},

The i-Tree Eco software application can be used to estimate regulating ecosystem services provided by urban forests. However, existing municipal tree inventories may not contain data necessary for running i-Tree Eco and manual field surveys are costly and time consuming. Using a tree inventory of Oslo, Norway, as an example, we demonstrate the potential of geospatial and machine learning methods to supple-ment missing and incomplete i-Tree Eco attributes in existing municipal inventories for the purpose of rapid lowcost urban ecosystem accounting. We correlate manually surveyed stem diameter and crown dimensions derived from airborne laser scanning imagery to complete most structural attributes. We then use auxiliary spatial datasets to derive missing attributes of trees' spatial context and include differentiation of air pollution levels. The integration of Oslo's tree inventory with available spatial data increases the proportion of records suitable for iTree Eco analysis from 19 \% to 54 \%. Furthermore, we illustrate how machine learning with Bayesian networks can be used to extrapolate i-Tree Eco outputs and infer the value of the entire municipal inventory. We find the expected total asset value of municipal trees in Oslo to be 38.5-43.4 million USD, depending on different modelling assumptions. We argue that there is a potential for greater use of geospatial methods in compiling information for valuation of urban tree inventories, especially when assessing location-specific tree characteristics, and for more spatially sensitive scaling methods for determining asset values of urban forests for the purpose of awareness-raising. However, given the available data in our case, we question the accuracy of values inferred by Bayesian networks in relation to the purposes of ecosystem accounting and tree compensation valuation.},

This specific ecosystem service can be quantified using i-Tree Eco software, but the software has some limitations. One limitation is that the pollution model used in the software cannot take into account spatial differences in pollutant concentrations, which occur in every city due to the diversity of polluters. This study aimed to investigate to what extent this limitation of the i-Tree Eco pollution model can influence the results obtained. The study was conducted in such a way that the i-Tree Eco project was broken down into four sub-projects, in which data on the concentration of selected pollutants from different air quality monitoring stations were analyzed using the coefficient of variation (CV). Three stations were designated as "urban background" type stations and one was a "traffic" type station. The study revealed relatively low variation (0.05 {\textless} CV {\textless} 0.23) in estimated quantities obtained based on concentrations of pollutants retrieved from different air quality monitoring stations of the same type ("urban background" type stations) and relatively high variation (0.24 {\textless} CV {\textless} 0.57) in estimated quantities obtained on data retrieved from different types of stations ("urban background" versus "traffic"). When data on air pollutant concentrations used in the model is from the "traffic" station type, trees provide air purification ecosystem services with an annual value almost twice as high (EUR 310 000) as when the data used is from "urban background" stations type (EUR 165 000). The results highlight the importance of ensuring that appropriate air pollution data for running a particular type of i-Tree Eco project is used.},

	abstract = {Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a common air pollutant that represents a significant threat to public health. In Dublin, a major source of PM2.5 is diesel exhaust, brake dust, and rubber fire particles from vehicles. Particulate matter can be deposited onto the surface of vegetation thereby removing it from the atmosphere. The presence of trees can increase the amount of surface area on which deposition can occur, but they can also alter wind flow in a way that increases local pollutant concentrations. This study assesses the effect of urban trees on removing PM2.5 using a novel combination of air quality monitoring and the i-Tree Eco (UFORE) deposition model during rush and non-rush hours with different traffic volumes. Monitoring was conducted in a tree alley and an area of no vegetation along the Drumcondra Road Lower in Dublin. Results indicated that there was no difference in PM2.5 concentrations outside of rush hours, but concentrations were significantly lower in the tree alley during rush hours compared to the street section with no trees. The i-Tree Eco model calculated that the tree alley could remove approximately 3 kg of PM2.5 on a yearly basis. Air monitoring found that the presence of trees resulted in a maximum air quality improvement of 126 \%, more than double what was predicted by i-Tree Eco. While this study provides an initial exploration of trees and air quality in Dublin, further research combining these techniques with the measurement of local wind speed and direction would allow for a better understanding of how Dublin's trees can affect its air quality. The results from this study suggest that they do cause a degree of air quality improvement and can be used to inform national clean air strategies aimed at reducing pollutant emissions.},

	abstract = {Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can pose health problems for humans following urbanization. Because urban vegetation has a large surface area to filter PM2.5 out of the air, it can be an effective long-term way to mitigate air pollution. Various studies have quantified PM2.5 removal by vegetation in cities, but the spatial variability of removal within cities and future scenarios have not been well documented. To ensure more reasonable and effective urban tree planting regimes, we used the spatiotemporal i-Tree Eco model combined with the vertical distribution of vegetation in a case study in Shenzhen City, China. The results indicated that the PM2.5 removal by urban vegetation in 2015 was 1000.1 tons, and the average removal rate by vegetation was 1.6 g m(-2) year(-1). A maximum hourly local air quality improvement of up to 3\% could be achieved, with an average of 1\%, which differed significantly with elevation. In terms of vegetation type, evergreen shrubs, evergreen broadleaved forests, and evergreen needle-leaved forests had the highest removal efficiency within {\textless}100, 100-300, and {\textgreater}300 m, respectively. For five future planting scenarios, by increasing vegetation cover by 5\% in different elevation zones ({\textless}100, 100-300, and {\textgreater}300 m), an annual amount of 1220.6-1308 tones could be achieved. Specifically, it was estimated that an increase in evergreen shrubs cover in the developed area ({\textless}100 m) would have the best removal potential. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Decision-makers and planners usually rely on standard economic accounting methods for urban planning and investments on infrastructure assets. However, standard methods fail to account for the ecosystem services benefits that living infrastructure (e.g. urban forests, open spaces) provides to city dwellers. This could generate socially inefficient configurations of urban spaces and compromise the achievement of long-term urban sustainability targets. In this analysis, we applied a stochastic whole-of-life benefit-cost analysis following the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) framework to compare alternative long-term management strategies for living infrastructure in Canberra, Australia. Spatially explicit data, i-Tree Eco and benefit transfer methods were used to estimate the stocks and flows ecosystem services benefits of urban forests and irrigated open spaces from 2018 to 2070. Our analysis suggests that a '30 per cent canopy cover expansion' scenario has the highest benefit-cost ratio, while the business as usual scenario, where a net loss of 400 trees is expected per year, offers the lowest benefit-cost ratio. Scenarios of expanding versus not expanding irrigated open spaces in the future both result in a benefit-cost ratio of approximately two.},

	abstract = {The potential to capture additional air pollutants by introducing more vegetation or changing existing short vegetation to woodland on first sight provides an attractive route for lowering urban pollution. Here, an atmospheric chemistry and transport model was run with a range of landcover scenarios to quantify pollutant removal by the existing total UK vegetation as well as the UK urban vegetation and to quantify the effect of large-scale urban tree planting on urban air pollution. UK vegetation as a whole reduces area (population)-weighted concentrations significantly, by 10\% (9\%) for PM2.5, 30\% (22\%) for SO2, 24\% (19\%) for NH3 and 15\% (13\%) for O-3, compared with a desert scenario. By contrast, urban vegetation reduces average urban PM2.5 by only approximately 1\%. Even large-scale conversion of half of existing open urban greenspace to forest would lower urban PM2.5 by only another 1\%, suggesting that the effect on air quality needs to be considered in the context of the wider benefits of urban tree planting, e.g. on physical and mental health. The net benefits of UK vegetation for NO2 are small, and urban tree planting is even forecast to increase urban NO2 and NOx concentrations, due to the chemical interaction with changes in BVOC emissions and O-3, but the details depend on tree species selection. By extrapolation, green infrastructure projects focusing on non-greenspace (roadside trees, green walls, roof-top gardens) would have to be implemented at very large scales to match this effect. Downscaling of the results to micro-interventions solely aimed at pollutant removal suggests that their impact is too limited for their cost-benefit analysis to compare favourably with emission abatement measures. Urban vegetation planting is less effective for lowering pollution than measures to reduce emissions at source. The results highlight interactions that cannot be captured if benefits are quantified via deposition models using prescribed concentrations, and emission damage costs.

These valuation tools quantify the natural environment in order to incorporate it within urban decision-making processes. In the UK, valuation tools have been used successfully to calculate commensurate replacement values for trees (e.g. Southwark, London), enhance the value of green infrastructure at the design stage (e.g. Wirral), and secure resource for future planting and maintenance (e.g. Wrexham). However, these valuation tools have not consistently had the desired positive impact on decisionmaking. In response, we have adapted the Business Model Canvas for use in green infrastructure valuation (BMC(4)GI) to create a framework that focuses the valuation process on the Change Objective, i.e. the decision that valuation intends to influence. The BMC(4)GI outlines nine building blocks to consider prior to valuation, namely; (i) Change Objective, (ii) Target Audience, (iii) Key Activities, (iv) Key Resources, (v) Key Partners, (vi) Channels, (vii) Audience Message, (viii) Cost Structure, and (ix) Revenue Streams. We link the BMC(4)GI to four general scenarios where valuation has proven to be successful, and provide a working example of the template based on green infrastructure valuation on a redevelopment site. BMC(4)GI can support any approach to green infrastructure valuation, globally, and we invite others to apply BMC(4)GI to create a shared case study library of good practice in green infrastructure valuation.},

However, as evaluation of the ESd-ESs balance based on averaged yearly data would minimize the impact of extreme values, the analysis based on seasonal data is important. Objectives To elucidate seasonal changes of and mismatches between ESd and ESs, we investigated (1) whether seasonal variations of ESs and ESd for PM(2.5)and SO(2)removal were synchronous; (2) in which season ESs could most/least satisfy ESd; (3) whether seasonal imbalance existed, although ESs might apparently satisfy ESd based on annual data; and (4) how spatial patterns of seasonal mismatches varied. Methods Deficit ratio and supply-demand ratio were utilized to assessed the risk of ESd-ESs mismatch for air purification and analyzed the extent to which ESs meets ESd respectively, on seasonal and annual timescales in Shenyang. Results The ESd and ESs of air purification ecosystem services for PM(2.5)and SO(2)are asynchronous. Inconsistency in the seasonal pattern between ESs and ESd induces severe mismatch between ESs and ESd in some seasons, e.g., winter. Assessment based on annual data could result in overoptimistic evaluations of ecosystem services. Conclusions The ESs-ESd balance isn't only spatially heterogeneous but also temporally heterogeneous. Therefore, explicit spatiotemporal analysis of ecosystem services would provide additional information that could help policy makers develop and implement effective targeted strategies.},

We used i-Tree Eco V6 for estimating carbon stock. There are 6,915 trees in the study area, out of which 73.0 percent (5,049 trees), 32.3 percent (2,236 trees), and 0.7 percent (50 trees) are native, understory, and invasive, respectively.The total carbon stored in trees is 3,450.4 t (SD = 65), and the annual sequestration rate is about 65 t. The University of Georgia should adopt a multifaceted approach for offsetting or reducing the overall carbon emissions, as annual sequestered carbon in measured trees is only 0.11 percent of the total carbon emitted by the university in 2018. This study highlights the role of trees in meeting the carbon reduction challenges faced by colleges and universities across the United States and beyond, and contextualizes the role of green spaces in general, and trees, in particular toward the ongoing movement of sustainable universities and campuses worldwide.
Study Implications: Across the United States and beyond, universities and colleges are actively exploring ways to reduce their overall environmental footprint for achieving sustainable development goals. Trees located on the campuses of universities and colleges provide various ecosystem services, including carbon storage and annual sequestration. We advise that universities and colleges should explore other options to reduce or offset their annual carbon emissions, as the quantity of carbon annually sequestered in trees located on the main campuses could be small relative to their overall annual carbon emissions.},

To estimate how differences in modeled tree growth translate to differences in ecosystem services, we compared annual ecosystem service estimates from Cincinnati and Indianapolis using the i-Tree Eco model. The comparisons showed varying levels of difference between cities; for example, modeled growth curves for Acer platanoides were nearly identical, while models for Pyrus calleryana differed by {\textgreater} 47\% over 35 years of growth. These results advance our understanding of urban tree growth rates by comparing models from two nearby cities, and by underscoring the inherent variability in urban tree growth that will drive attendant differences in the ecosystem services provided by trees.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem services (ES) are used as a tool for eco-environment management, and this study establishes a framework that integrates ecological red line (ERL), public perceptions of ES and trade-offs among ES into regional eco-environment management. The public perceptions of ES are assessed using questionnaires and statistical analyses. Three models (InVEST, i-Tree Eco, ROS), a food supply calculation method and GIS are used to quantify eight ecological indicators (water yield, soil retention, water purification, biodiversity conservation, atmospheric regulation, outdoor recreation, food supply, and prohibited development zones) in the Fenghe River watershed (FRW). Three ecological function areas are delineated via the ERL standard, and the trade-offs among ES are assessed via correlation analysis. The results show the following: 1) the top five preferred ES by the public are atmospheric regulation, water purification, food supply, freshwater supply and outdoor recreation, and the local environment and individual demands are the main factors that affect preferences; 2) from 2000 to 2015, the quantity of the water yield, soil retention, Nitrogen output and biodiversity index slightly decreases, and the amount of the NO2 removal, food supply and outdoor recreation index slightly increases; 3) based on the "Delimitation scheme for ERL of Xi'an", the FRW is divided into ecological redline zone (ERZ), ecological function important zone and ecological function general zone, and the ERZ accounts for the largest proportion (55.7\%); and 4) inconsistent trade-offs/synergies among ES are observed in different ecological function areas. Based on these results, we establish a management framework and propose corresponding measures to improve ES for different ecological function areas. This multi-dimensional composite management framework can be used for planning or environmental management.},

	abstract = {With increasing realization that particles in the air are a major health risk in urban areas, strengthening particle deposition is discussed as a means to air-pollution mitigation. Particles are deposited physically on leaves and thus the process depends on leaf area and surface properties, which change throughout the year. Current state-of-the-art modeling accounts for these changes only by altering leaf longevity, which may be selected by vegetation type and geographic location. Particle removal also depends on weather conditions, which determine deposition and resuspension but generally do not consider properties that are specific to species or plant type. In this study, we modeled {\textless}2.5 mu m-diameter particulate-matter (PM2.5) deposition, resuspension, and removal from urban trees along a latitudinal gradient (Berlin, Munich, Rome) while comparing coniferous with broadleaf (deciduous and evergreen) tree types. Accordingly, we re-implemented the removal functionality from the i-Tree Eco model, investigated the uncertainty connected with parameterizations, and evaluated the efficiency of pollution mitigation depending on city conditions. We found that distinguishing deposition velocities between conifers and broadleaves is important for model results, i.e., because the removal efficiency of conifers is larger. Because of the higher wind speed, modeled PM2.5 deposition from conifers is especially large in Berlin compared to Munich and Rome. Extended periods without significant precipitation decrease the amount of PM2.5 removal because particles that are not occasionally washed from the leaves or needles are increasingly resuspended into the air. The model predicted this effect particularly during the long summer periods in Rome with only very little precipitation and may be responsible for less-efficient net removal from urban trees under climate change. Our analysis shows that the range of uncertainty in particle removal is large and that parameters have to be adjusted at least for major tree types if not only the species level. Furthermore, evergreen trees (broadleaved as well as coniferous) are predicted to be more effective at particle removal in northern regions than in Mediterranean cities, which is unexpected given the higher number of evergreens in southern cities. We discuss to what degree the effect of current PM2.5 abundance can be mitigated by species selection and which model improvements are needed.},

	abstract = {The determination of an asset's economic value has always been an important step in improving its management. The Madrid Region legislated the application of the first version of the Norma Granada as a method of appraising ornamental trees. However, the trees in the city of Madrid are only assessed in terms of ecosystem services (i-Tree Eco). A photograph of the asset to be appraised is often used in studies on the valuation of publicly-owned socio-environmental assets such as trees or landscapes. As a tree's value is very closely linked to its size and to a number of features that can be seen through direct observation of the specimen, it is important to verify the validity of photographs as a method for obtaining the public's opinion. This work presents a comparison between the valuations chosen by members of the public when observing the tree in situ and in a photograph. The aim is to verify the validity of photographs for their application to a larger sample and to understand qualitatively how citizens assess the trees in a city. The following appraisal methods were used: the American method, Council of Tree Landscape Appraisers (CTLA), Norma Granada and the Burnley method. The survey consisted of ten specimens from ten different species, and ten surveys were taken for each stem, making a total of 100 for each tree species and 1000 surveys in all. The surveys were done randomly and individually. Each interviewed chose one of the three values they were shown when observing the specimen in the photograph and in situ; 84\% of the 1000 surveys gave as a result the same value choice when looking at the specimen on site and seeing it in a photograph.},

	abstract = {Street trees are an important component of green infrastructure in cities, providing multiple ecosystem services (ES) and hence contributing to urban resilience, sustainability and livability. Still, access to these benefits may display an uneven distribution across the urban fabric, potentially leading to socio-environmental inequalities. Some studies have analyzed the distributional justice implications of street tree spatial patterns, but generally without quantifying the associated ES provision. This research estimated the amount of air purification, runoff mitigation and temperature regulation provided by circa 200,000 street trees in Barcelona, Spain, using the i-Tree Eco tool. Results were aggregated at neighborhood (n = 73) and census tract (n = 1068) levels to detect associations with the distribution of five demographic variables indicating social vulnerability, namely: income, residents from the Global South, residents with low educational attainment, elderly residents, and children. Associations were evaluated using bivariate, multivariate and cluster analyses, including a spatial autoregressive model. Unlike previous studies, we found no evidence of a significant and positive association between the distribution of low income or Global South residents and a lower amount of street tree benefits in Barcelona. Rather, higher ES provision by street trees was associated with certain types of vulnerable populations, especially elderly citizens. Our results also suggest that street trees can play an important redistributive role in relation to the local provision of regulating ES due to the generally uneven and patchy distribution of other urban green infrastructure components such as urban forests, parks or gardens in compact cities such as Barcelona. In the light of these findings, we contend that just green infrastructure planning should carefully consider the distributive implications associated with street tree benefits.},

	abstract = {Promoting urban greenery through tree planting strategies has been considered as a measure to mitigate climate change. While it is essential to understand the temporal dynamics of urban forest structure as well as its services and contribution to human wellbeing in cities, it has hardly ever been examined whether the future contributions of these services after different possible planting strategies can comply with climate change policy goals; these are topics rarely discussed in urban planning and management. In this paper, the ecosystem services currently provided by urban trees (through carbon sequestration and storage), as well as those potentially provided in the future, were quantified using the i-Tree Eco model, and their contribution to climate change mitigation was evaluated. As a case study in Tabriz, Iran, we developed four possible scenarios. Synergy (urban temperature regulation by UF) and trade-off (tree water requirements) were also analyzed. Future carbon sequestration and storage potential of urban trees was compared with the estimated future carbon emissions. The current contribution in Tabriz is relatively modest (about 0.2\%), but it can be tripled through long-term tree planting strategies. Additionally, the temporal cooling effects and tree water requirements increase as climate change mitigation improves through tree planting. We conclude that urban tree planting has a small impact on carbon mitigation in the study area, most likely because of the young age of trees in Tabriz as well as the fact that the planted trees cannot deliver all their benefits over a 20-years period and need more time. Thus, the use of urban trees serves only as a complementary solution rather than an alternative climate mitigation strategy. Our quantitative approach helps urban environmental policymakers to evaluate how much they can rely on urban forest strategies to achieve climate change mitigation targets.},

Nevertheless, there is still a lack of quantitative understanding of the effects of the increases in tree cover on the future potential of urban forests when it comes to air quality improvement. Therefore, this research aims to assess and quantify the current and future biophysical and monetary value of the regulating ecosystem service provided by urban forest in Tabriz, Iran (as a case study). Both the current conditions and future prospect are assessed through tree planting scenarios based on the i-tree Eco model. The results indicate that the trees and shrubs removed 238.4 t of pollutants during a year (in 2015), which suggests only a modest potential in air purification when compared with other cities around the world. However, through appropriate - though feasible - urban forest management and development practices, they may improve up to 814.46 t cumulatively over the next 20 years. Tree planting schemes have different efficacies in terms of providing air purification services. Our data-rich temporal approach allowed identifying the optimum tree planting strategy, taking into account the growth and mortality dynamics. Thus, the paper illustrates a methodology to assess the current and future potentials of urban forests to reduce air pollution at the city-scale, which helps the development of future urban tree planting strategies in cities to improve air quality as well as the management of the green infrastructure. Our approach paves the way for the quantitative assessment and optimization of the future condition of (urban) ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {The ecosystem services provided by urban forests contribute to ameliorate air quality and human well-being in cities. An integrated approach based on direct measurements of leaf functional multi-traits and on estimation of the plant mitigation potential was used for predicting the species-specific impact on air quality of 29 species, including trees and shrubs, commonly present in the urban context. In addition, volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions and ozone forming potential (OFP) of each species were evaluated. At plant levels, pollution deposition equations and the i-Tree Eco model were applied for estimating particulate (PM10) and ozone (O-3) removal potential and for calculating carbon dioxide (CO2) storage and sequestration by the studied species. The results highlight the plant species-specific ability to capture atmospheric pollutants based on their physiological (CO2 assimilation and stomatal conductance) and morphological (stomata, trichomes, waxes and cuticular ornamentation) leaf traits. Trees with abundant trichomes, waxes and wrinkled leaf surfaces are considered more suitable for capturing pollutants. Most of the studied species are suitable for urban planning programs as they result for the majority low VOC emitters and consequently are characterized by low or moderate OFP. Annual O-3 and PM10, removal of the investigated trees species ranged from about 58-140 g plant(-1) yr(-1) and from about 17-139 g plant(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Total tree CO2 storage ranged from about 164-215 kg plant(-1) and gross annual CO2 sequestration from 11 to 20 kg plant(-1) year(-1). Liriodendron tulipifera, Celtis australis, Acer campestre and Acer platanoides, were efficient species in capturing PM10 and absorbing O-3. Prunus cerasifera, Quercus cerris, together with Celtis australis, Acer campestre and Acer platanoides, were efficient for carbon sequestration and storage. As aspected, lower potential of pollutant removal and CO2 storage and sequestration were estimated for shrubs, due to their smaller leaf area and structure.},

Ecological benefits of street trees now are attracting more attention because of environmental deterioration in cities. Conventional methods of evaluating ecological benefits require a lot of labor and time, and establishing an efficient and effective evaluating method is challenging. In this study, we investigated the feasibility to use mobile laser scanning (MLS) data to evaluate carbon sequestration and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) removal of street trees. We explored the approach to extract individual street trees from MLS data, and street trees of three streets in Nantong City were extracted. The correctness rates and completeness rates of extraction results were both over 92\%. Morphological parameters, including tree height, crown width, and diameter at breast height (DBH), were measured for extracted street trees, and parameters derived from MLS data were in a good agreement with field-measured parameters. Necessary information about street trees, including tree height, DBH, and tree species, meteorological data and PM2.5 deposition velocities were imported into i-Tree Eco model to estimate carbon sequestration and PM2.5 removal. The estimation results indicated that ecological benefits generated by different tree species were considerably varied and the differences for trees of the same species were mainly caused by the differences in morphological parameters (tree height and DBH). This study succeeds in estimating the amount of carbon sequestration and PM2.5 removal of individual street trees with MLS data, and provides researchers with a novel and efficient way to investigate ecological benefits of urban street trees or urban forests.},

We assess commonly used methods for comparing tree diversity in peri-urban and urban forests when available data have different sample sizes, plot sizes, and sampling intensities. We present methods for appropriately evaluating species richness, as well as methods for comparing species distributions via community data matrices. Using permanent plot data from the southeastern United States, we present a case study comparing urban and peri-urban forests along a north-south gradient, and assessing species richness and the ecological homogenization hypothesis. Our findings indicate that comparisons of tree species richness among communities, or forest types, are often inconclusive since commonly used sample sizes do not provide precise estimates of the number of species present. While the ecological homogenization hypotheses can be tested under conditions of unequal sampling effort, we suggest robust methods such as PERMANOVA and the Raup-Crick dissimilarity index. A framework for selecting appropriate methods is also discussed. As forests are increasingly being altered by anthropogenic drivers, future studies using disparate data sources must account for differences in measurements and sampling protocols in order to produce results that are both statistically defensible and useful for science-based management.},

Calculation of pollution removal capacity using local environmental data indicates that grasslands and shrublands remove a total of 6.42 million tonnes of air pollutants in the United States and the associated monetary benefits total \$268 million. Human health impacts and associated monetary value due to pollution removal was observed to be significantly high in urban areas indicating that grasslands and shrublands are equally critical as canopy in improving air quality and human health in urban regions.},

Algorithms and models that link the properties of plant functional types, species groups, or single species to their impact on specific ecosystem services have been developed. However, these models require a considerable effort for initialization that is inherently related to uncertainties originating from the high diversity of plant species in urban areas. We therefore suggest a new automated method to be used with the i-Tree Eco model to derive light competition for individual trees and investigate the importance of this property. Since competition depends also on the species, which is difficult to determine from increasingly used remote sensing methodologies, we also investigate the impact of uncertain tree species classification on the ecosystem services by comparing a species-specific inventory determined by field observation with a genus-specific categorization and a model initialization for the dominant deciduous and evergreen species only. Our results show how the simulation of competition affects the determination of carbon sequestration, leaf area, and related ecosystem services and that the proposed method provides a tool for improving estimations. Misclassifications of tree species can lead to large deviations in estimates of ecosystem impacts, particularly concerning biogenic volatile compound emissions. In our test case, monoterpene emissions almost doubled and isoprene emissions decreased to less than 10\% when species were estimated to belong only to either two groups instead of being determined by species or genus. It is discussed that this uncertainty of emission estimates propagates further uncertainty in the estimation of potential ozone formation. Overall, we show the importance of using an individual light competition approach and explicitly parameterizing all ecosystem functions at the species-specific level.},

A comprehensive literature review, field measurements and observations, including photographs, and quantitative based approach to assessing vacant land forest structure and values (i-Tree Eco sampling) were utilized, along with aerial photo interpretation, and ground-truthing methods, to identify and catalog vacant parcels of land.; The following types of urban vacant land were identified: post-industrial (3.34 km(2)), derelict (4.01 km(2)), unattended with vegetation (17.3 km(2)), natural (2.78 km(2)), and transportation-related (5.01 km(2)). Unattended with vegetation sites can be important resources that support urban ecosystem health; the most effective ecosystem benefits occur in natural sites based on their per-ha value. The redesign of post-industrial sites could build a city's image, while transportation-related sites can contribute a green infrastructure network of open spaces across a city. This typological study could have significant implications for policy development, and for planners and designers seeking to utilize urban vacant land to the best advantage.},

	abstract = {Megacities contain at least 10 million people whose wellbeing largely depends on ecosystem services provided by remote natural areas. What is, however, most often disregarded is that nature conservation in the city can also contribute to human wellbeing benefits. The most common mind set separates cities from the rest of nature, as if they were not special kinds of natural habitats. Instead, awareness that urban systems are also nature and do host biodiversity and ecosystem services opportunities, should push urban people towards increased urban forest conservation and implementation strategies. This research estimated existing and potential, tree cover, and its contribution to ecosystem services in 10 megacity metropolitan areas, across 5 different continents and biomes. We developed estimates for each megacity using local data to transform i-Tree Eco estimates of tree cover benefits to reductions in air pollution, stormwater, building energy, and carbon emissions for London, UK. The transformation used biophysical scaling equations based on local megacity tree cover, human population, air pollution, climate, energy use, and purchasing power parity. The megacity metropolitan areas ranged from 1173 to 18,720 sq km (median value 2530 sq km), with median tree cover 21\%, and potential tree cover another 19\% of the city. Megacities had a median tree cover density of 39 m(2)/capita, much smaller than the global average value of 7800 m2/capita, with density lower in desert and tropical biomes, and higher in temperate biomes. The present median benefit value from urban trees in all 10 megacities can be estimated as \$482 million/yr due to reductions in CO, NO2, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5, \$11 million/yr due to avoided stormwater processing by wastewater facilities, \$0.5 million/yr due to building energy heating and cooling savings, and \$8 million/yr due to CO2 sequestration. Planting more trees in potential tree cover areas could nearly double the benefits provided by the urban forest. In 2016 there were 40 megacities, totaling 722 million residents, nearly 10\% of the human population, who would benefit from nature conservation plans where they work and live. Nature conservation strategies in megacities should work to sustain and grow the benefits of the urban forest, and improve accounting methods to include additional ecosystem services provided by the urban forest.

Several ecosystem service estimation studies have been conducted acting upon the assumption that relationships developed elsewhere are applicable to sites that vary in species, site, climate, and environmental conditions. This study tested the accuracy of highly used existing leaf area and biomass models when used outside the region in which it was developed. To do this, we measured 74 urban trees from five species in Stevens Point, Wisconsin collecting data such as diameter at breast height (Dbh), tree height, height to the base of live crown, crown width, crown volume, leaf area, and leaf dry weight biomass. Using the data, we developed two models each to predict leaf area and biomass. Using ten independent samples, we compared our predictions with predictions from the existing models which are also used in i-Tree. Our results indicated that the local models developed in the current study predicted leaf area and biomass better than existing models which had higher prediction error. The difference in prediction will ultimately affect ecosystem services estimation when. using i-Tree, and future studies should acknowledge the difference.},

GI practices such as trees, green roofs and green walls are widely used in United States and Europe to mitigate the air pollution. However, there is yet limited knowledge available in identifying the most suitable GI strategy for an urban area in improving the air quality. Furthermore, it is evident that Australia is still lagging behind in adapting GI to mitigate air pollution, compared with US and Europe. Therefore, this study analyzed the air quality improvement through several GI scenarios consisting of trees, green roofs and green walls considering a case study area in Melbourne, Australia by using the i-Tree Eco software. The results were compared with case studies in different cities across the world. The results showed that the i-Tree Eco software can be successfully applied to an Australian case study area to quantify the air quality improvement benefits of GI. The results were further assessed with several environmental, economic and social indicators to identify the most suitable GI scenarios for the study area. These indicators were quantified using different methods, to assess the effectiveness of different GI scenarios. The results showed that, trees provided the highest air pollution removal capability among the different GI considered for the study area. Combination of different GI such as green roofs and green walls with trees did not provide a significant increment of air quality improvement however, has provided more local benefits such as building energy savings. The results obtained from this study were also beneficial in developing policies related to future GI applications in major cities of Australia for the air quality improvement.

These trees store an approximate total of 309,700 (73,726 SEM) metric tons of carbon and sequester 16,271 (2965 SEM) metric tons of CO2 annually. Additional research is needed to develop functional relationships for urban trees in Thailand to overcome a current limitation for using i-Tree Eco in Thailand to estimate structural and functional value of urban forests.

Using i-Tree Eco software and its sampling and data collection protocol, an assessment of the baseline condition, ecological function, and value of the urban forests in Scotlandville (Louisiana, USA) was conducted during 2014. A stratified (by land use type) random sample plot map of the town was generated. Data from 170 field plots located throughout Scotlandville were collected, including tree species, diameter at breast height, total tree height, height to live top, height to crown base, crown width, crown dieback, crown light exposure, percent impervious surface under the tree, and direction and distance to building. Data were then entered into i-Tree Eco v5.0 and analyzed. Modeling results indicated that there are a total of 31 species and an estimated 239,000 trees in Scotlandville with a tree canopy cover of 23.7 percent; the three most common species are Black willow (Salix nigra), Water oak (Quercus nigra), and American elm (Ulmus americana); the overall tree density is 77 trees per hectare and trees with diameters of more than 15 cm (6 inches) constitute 56.5\% of the population. The model estimated that annually, the urban forests in Scotlandville remove 96 tons of air pollutants; gross sequestration is about 3,880 tons of carbon and net carbon sequestration is about 3,650 tons. Each year, trees in Scotlandville are estimated to store 88,700 tons of carbon, produce 9,720 tons of oxygen, reduce runoff by 121,200 m(3), reduce energy-related costs by \$324,000 USD, and provide an additional \$52,595 in value by reducing the amount of carbon released by power plants (a reduction of 739 tons of carbon emissions). The structural value for Scotlandville community forest is estimated at \$185 million and the annual ecological functional value is estimated at 9 million USD.

However, to date, we have rather few empirical studies on the magnitude and value of the effects of trees on air quality and human health, especially especially within the climatic conditions of Central Europe. To investigate the significance of urban trees from the point of view of air pollution removal, an i-Tree Eco model was implemented. The results indicate that the 932 trees in Krasinski Gardens (Warsaw, Poland) absorb 267.12 kg of pollutants per year: 149.9 kg of O-3, 94.4 kg of NO2, 11.8 kg of SO2 and 10.9 kg of PM2.5. That makes an average removal per tree (calculated by summarizing the values of all of the pollutants) of 0.287 kg/year. Furthermore, health values were used to estimate their pollution removal services in monetary terms. The total benefit of air purification by trees in Krasinski Gardens is estimated at 26250 PLN/year with an average value per tree of: 28 PLN. Although PM2.5 removal is the lowest among the four air pollutants analysed, accounting for only 4\% of the total mass reduction, it provides 69\% of the total economic value. The benefit associated with absorption of O-3 provided 28\% of the value, with the absorption of NO2 and SO2 at just 3\%. The results also show that large tree species (with a crown diameter of 14-15m) can provide around 10 times higher benefits, than small ones (5-6m).},

In addition, photo interpretation of aerial images was used to determine changes in tree cover between the mid-1990s and 2009. Between the mid-1990s and 2003, tree cover in Syracuse exhibited a decline from 27.5 to 25.9 \%, but subsequently increased to 26.9 \% by 2009. The total tree population exhibited a similar pattern, dropping from 881,000 trees in 1999 to 862,000 in 2001, and then increasing to 1,087,000 trees in 2009. Most of this increase in the urban tree population is due to invasive or pioneer trees species, particularly Rhamnus cathartica, which has more than tripled in population between 2001 and 2009. Insects such as gypsy moth and emerald ash borer pose a substantial risk to altering future urban forest composition. The annual ecosystem services provided by the urban forest in relation to carbon sequestration, air pollution removal and reduction in building energy use are estimated at about \$2.4 million per year.

Measurements made using plot sampling methods yield useful results including citywide or land-use level estimates of species counts, leaf area, biomass, and air pollution reduction. However, these quantities are statistical estimates made over large areas and thus are not spatially explicit. Maps of forest structure and function at the individual tree crown scale can enhance management decision-making and improve understanding of the spatial distribution of ecosystem services relative to humans and infrastructure. In this research we used hyperspectral imagery and waveform lidar data to directly map urban forest species, leaf area index (LAI), and carbon storage in downtown Santa Barbara, California. We compared these results to estimates produced using field-plot sampling and the i-Tree Eco model. Remote sensing methods generally reduced uncertainty in species-level canopy cover estimates compared to field-plot methods. This was due to high classification accuracy for species with large canopies (e.g., Platanus racemosa with similar to 90\% average accuracy, Pinus pinea at similar to 93\%, Quercus agrifolia at similar to 83\%) and high standard error of the plot-based estimates due to the uneven distribution of canopy throughout the city. Average LAI in canopy, based on lidar measurements was 4.47 while field measurements and allometry resulted in an LAI of 5.57. Citywide carbon storage, based on lidar measurements and allometry was estimated at 50,991 metric tons (t) and 55,900 t from plot-sampling. As others have noted, carbon density varied substantially by development intensity based largely on differences in fractional cover but less so when only evaluating canopy biomass. Using separate biomass equations for each leaf type (broadleaf, needleleaf, palm) resulted in a more accurate carbon map but a less accurate citywide estimate. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Applied for the first time in a French city, the model shows that public trees, i.e., trees managed by the city, removed about 88 t of pollutants during one year period (from July 2012 to June 2013): about 1 ton for CO; 14 tons for NO2; 56 tons for O-3; 12 tons for PM10coarse (particles with diameter ranging from 2.5 to 10 mu m); 5 tons for PM2.5 and 1 ton for SO2. Air pollution removal varied mainly with the tree cover and the level of air pollutants concentrations. Comparison between simulated pollution removal rates and local emissions shows that public trees of Strasbourg reduce about 7\% of the emitted PM10coarse in the city's atmosphere; however, effect on other air pollutants is small. Thus, our study reveals that urban trees are a significant element to reduce air pollution but are not the only solution to this problem.

Models such as i-Tree Eco enable decision-making by quantifying effects associated with particular tree species. Of specific concern are emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds, particularly isoprene, that contribute to the formation of photochemical smog and ground level ozone. Few studies have quantified these potential disservices of urban trees, and current models predominantly use emissions data from trees that differ from those in our target region of subtropical Australia. The present study aimed (i) to quantify isoprene emission rates of three tree species that together represent 16\% of the inventoried street trees in the target region; (ii) to evaluate outputs of the i-Tree Eco model using species-specific versus currently used, generic isoprene emission rates; and (iii) to evaluate the findings in the context of regional air quality. Isoprene emission rates of Xanthostemon chrysanthus (Myrtaceae) and Buckinghamia celsissima (Proteaceae) were 2.61 and 2.06 mu g g(-1) dry leaf weight h(-1), respectively, whereas Harpullia pendula (Sapindaceae) was a nonisoprene emitter. We substituted the generic isoprene emission rates with these three empirical values in i-Tree Eco, resulting in a 182 kg yr(-1) (97\%) reduction in isoprene emissions, totaling 6284 kg yr(-1) when extrapolated to the target region. From these results we conclude that care has to be taken when using generic isoprene emission factors for urban tree models. We recommend that emissions be quantified for commonly planted trees, allowing decision-makers to select tree species with the greatest overall benefit for the urban environment.},

Two important regulating services of urban trees, carbon sequestration and air pollution removal, are evaluated in this article for different types of tree stands (streets, parks) in the city centre of Szeged (Hungary). The necessary calculations were carried out by an adaptation of the targeted model (i-Tree Eco), based on a large complete tree inventory dataset. The analyses revealed the main tendencies in differences between tree species considering the tree condition, which affects the service-providing capacity to a high degree. The effects of differences in tree management on the chosen ecosystem services were investigated by comparing two pairs of tree alleys. Based on our observations, clear cuts and complete tree alley changes are not advisable from an ecosystem service point of view.},

Aerial photo interpretation with ground-truthing was used to identify and catalog vacant parcels of land within the city limits and the results mapped using the i-Tree Canopy and i-Tree Eco models to define land cover classes and quantify ecosystem structure and services. An analysis of urban forest cover in Roanoke's vacant land reveals that this area has about 210,000 trees, with a tree cover of 30.6\%. These trees store about 97,500 t of carbon, valued at \$7.6 million. In addition, these trees remove about 2090 t of carbon (valued at \$164,000), and about 83 t of air pollutants (valued at \$916,000) every year, which is high relative to other land uses in Roanoke. Trees on vacant land in the city are estimated to reduce annual residential energy costs by \$211,000 for the city's 97,000 residents. The structural value of the trees growing on vacant land is estimated at \$169 million. Information on the structure and functions of urban forests on vacant land can be used to evaluate the contribution made by urban vacant land's green infrastructure to improving environmental quality. The methodology applied to assess ecosystem services in this study can also be used to assess ecosystem services of vacant land in other urban contexts. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Compact or clustered subdivision designs have the potential to improve carbon storage and sequestration through the conservation of open space and the preservation of existing trees found on built lots. However, very few empirical studies assess how different subdivision designs and tree preservation strategies affect the carbon footprint of proposed residential developments. Using a 705 ha pine plantation that has been approved for the development of 1835 residential units near Gainesville, Florida, our objectives were to determine which site designs and tree preservation strategies could maximize carbon sequestration and storage. From 80 stratified random plots, we measured and analyzed tree and plot characteristics according to forest type and tree stand age categories. Tree data collected from these plots were analyzed with the i-Tree ECO model to estimate baseline predevelopment carbon stores and sequestration rates. Using ArcMap, we then assessed the impact, on baseline carbon sequestration and storage capacity, of several different site designs and tree conservation scenarios for the proposed development. Up to 91\% of carbon storage and up to 82\% of carbon sequestration could be maintained through a cluster urban development design and by preserving older tree stands. Results indicate that a subdivision's carbon footprint can significantly improve when forest types and tree preservation are incorporated into the design of a development. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Urban forest inventory data analyzed by programs such as the i-Tree ECO inventory method is a good candidate for such an approach. In this research, we tested the feasibility of using spatially referenced data gathered and submitted by non-professional individuals through a web application to augment urban forest inventory data. We examined the use of close range photogrammetry solutions of images taken by consumer-grade cameras to extract quantitative metric information such as crown diameter, tree heights and trunk diameters. Several tests were performed to evaluate the accuracy of the photogrammetric solutions and to examine their use in addition to existing aerial image data to supplement or partially substitute for standard i-Tree ECO field measurements.
Digital images of three sample sites were acquired using different consumer-grade cameras. Several photogrammetric solutions were performed using the acquired image sets. Each model was carried out using a relative orientation process followed by baseline model scaling. Several distances obtained through this solution were compared to the corresponding distances obtained through direct measurements in order to assess the quality of the model scaling approach. Measured i-Tree ECO field plot inventory data, online aerial image measurements and photogrammetric observations were compared. The results demonstrate the potential for using aerial image digitizing in addition to ground images to assist in participatory urban forest inventory efforts. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

To protect biodiversity not only outside but also right within urban areas, knowledge about the effects of urban land use on species assemblages is essential. Sonja Knapp compares several aspects of plant biodiversity between urban and rural areas in Germany. Using extensive databases and modern statistical methods, she goes beyond species richness: Urban areas are rich in species but plant species in urban areas are closer related to each other than plant species in rural areas, respectively. The urban environment, characterized by high temperatures and frequent disturbances, changes the functional composition of the flora. It promotes e.g. short-lived species with leaves adapted to drought but threatens insect-pollinated or wind-dispersed species. The author claims that the protection of biodiversity should not only focus on species richness but also on functional and phylogenetic diversity, also right within urban areas, to preserve a flora with a high potential for adaptation to changing global conditions.},

Therefore, quantitative information on residents’ valuation concerning urban forests is needed for assessing urban land use. The purpose of this investigation was to study the valuation of urban forests in two different urban environments Joensuu and Salo, Finland. The aims were to study the attitudes towards and benefits related to the use of urban forests and, in particular, to measure the valuations in monetary terms using contingent valuation, i.e. measure the residents’ willingness-to-pay for larger wooded recreation areas and for small forested parks. Urban forests were seen in both towns as clearly producing positive benefits rather than causing negative effects. The negative features of forests were related to the management of the areas rather than their existence. The main values were related to nature and social functions of forests. In contrast, timber production achieved a distinctively low priority in both study towns. The results stress the importance of defining urban forest policies for municipalities in Finland. More than two-thirds of the respondents were willing to pay for the use of recreation areas. Good location and active management raised the average WTP. Moreover, approximately half of the respondents were willing to pay for preventing construction in urban forests. The results also show that the monetary value of amenity benefits in recreation areas is much higher than the present maintenance costs. The examples concerning the advantageousness of construction on green areas suggest that a limit could be found where the infill of housing areas is not worthwhile from the point of view of society, if the losses of green space benefits are taken into account.},

Economic approaches used to estimate value of greenspace services include travel cost, willingness to pay, hedonic pricing and tree valuation. These methods have limited utility for policy-makers, planners, and managers because the underlying values they estimate only indirectly reflect the flow of multiple benefits and costs. A greenspace accounting approach to partially address this deficiency is described using benefit-cost analysis for a proposed tree-planting project in Tucson. AZ. The approach directly connects vegetation structure with the spatial-temporal flow of functional benefits and costs. Prices are assigned to each cost (i.e. planting, pruning, removal, irrigation) and benefit (i.e. cooling energy savings, interception of particulates, stormwater runoff reduction) through direct estimation and implied valuation of benefits as environmental externalities. The approach can be used to evaluate net economic benefits associated with capital investments in urban forests vs. other investments in the urban infrastructure or traditional environmental control technologies.},

	abstract = {Urban species and habitats provide important ecosystem services such as summertime cooling, recreation, and pollination at a variety of scales. Many studies have assessed how biodiversity responds to urbanization, but little work has been done to try and create recommendations that can be easily applied to urban planning, design and management practice. Urban planning often operates at broad spatial scales, typically using relatively simplistic targets for land-cover mix to influence biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Would more complicated, but still easily created, prescriptions for urban vegetation be beneficial? Here we assess the importance of vegetation measures (percentage vegetation cover, tree canopy cover and variation in canopy height) across four taxonomic groups (bats, bees, hoverflies and birds) at multiple spatial scales (100, 250, 500, 1000 m) within a major urban area (Birmingham, the United Kingdom). We found that small-scale (100–250-m radius) measures of vegetation were important predictors for hoverflies and bees, and that bats were sensitive to vegetation at a medium spatial-scale (250–500 m). In contrast, birds responded to vegetation characteristics at both small (100 m) and large (1000 m) scales. Vegetation cover, tree cover and variation in canopy height were expected to decrease with built surface cover; however, only vegetation cover showed this expected trend. The results indicate the importance of relatively small patches of vegetationfor supporting urban biodiversity, and show that relatively simple measures of vegetation characteristics can be useful predictors of species richness (or activity density, in the case of bats). They also highlight the danger of relying upon percentage built surface cover as an indicator of urban biodiversity potential.},

However, with global change, monospecific plantations are increasingly vulnerable to abiotic and biotic disturbances. As an adaption measure we need to move to plantations that are more diverse in genotypes, species, and structure, with a design underpinned by science. TreeDivNet, a global network of tree diversity experiments, responds to this need by assessing the advantages and disadvantages of mixed species plantations. The network currently consists of 18 experiments, distributed over 36 sites and five ecoregions. With plantations 1–15 years old, TreeDivNet can already provide relevant data for forest policy and management. In this paper, we highlight some early results on the carbon sequestration and pest resistance potential of more diverse plantations. Finally, suggestions are made for new, innovative experiments in understudied regions to complement the existing network.},

	abstract = {The majority of humanity now lives in cities or towns, with this proportion expected to continue increasing for the foreseeable future. As novel ecosystems, urban areas offer an ideal opportunity to examine multi-scalar processes involved in community assembly as well as the role of human activities in modulating environmental drivers of biodiversity. Although ecologists have made great strides in recent decades at documenting ecological relationships in urban areas, much remains unknown, and we still need to identify the major ecological factors, aside from habitat loss, behind the persistence or extinction of species and guilds of species in cities. Given this paucity of knowledge, there is an immediate need to facilitate collaborative, interdisciplinary research on the patterns and drivers of biodiversity in cities at multiple spatial scales. In this review, we introduce a new conceptual framework for understanding the filtering processes that mold diversity of urban floras and faunas. We hypothesize that the following hierarchical series of filters influence species distributions in cities: (1) regional climatic and biogeographical factors; (2) human facilitation; (3) urban form and development history; (4) socioeconomic and cultural factors; and (5) species interactions. In addition to these filters, life history and functional traits of species are important in determining community assembly and act at multiple spatial scales. Using these filters as a conceptual framework can help frame future research needed to elucidate processes of community assembly in urban areas. Understanding how humans influence community structure and processes will aid in the management, design, and planning of our cities to best support biodiversity.},

However, we still lack adequate theories and models to provide robust generalizations, predictions, and interpretations for such results. Here I present a mechanistic model of a spatially structured ecosystem in which plants compete for a limiting soil nutrient. This model shows that plant species richness does not necessarily enhance ecosystem processes, but it identifies two types of factors that could generate such an effect: (i) complementarity among species in the space they occupy below ground and (ii) positive correlation between mean resource-use intensity and diversity. In both cases, the model predicts that plant biomass, primary productivity, and nutrient retention all increase with diversity, similar to results reported in recent field experiments. These two factors, however, have different implications for the understanding of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The model also shows that the effect of species richness on productivity or other ecosystem processes is masked by the effects of physical environmental parameters on these processes. Therefore, comparisons among sites cannot reveal it, unless abiotic conditions are very tightly controlled. Identifying and separating out the mechanisms behind ecosystem responses to biodiversity should become the focus of future experiments.},

Several experiments have provided evidence that reduced species diversity may impair ecosystem processes such as plant biomass production1,2,3,4,5. The interpretation of these experiments, however, has been controversial6,7,8,9,10,11,12 because two types of mechanism may operate in combination6,13,14,15. In the ‘selection effect’, dominance by species with particular traits affects ecosystem processes. In the ‘complementarity effect’, resource partitioning or positive interactions lead to increased total resource use. Here we present a new approach to separate the two effects on the basis of an additive partitioning analogous to the Price equation in evolutionary genetics16,17,18,19. Applying this method to data from the pan-European BIODEPTH experiment4 reveals that the selection effect is zero on average and varies from negative to positive in different localities, depending on whether species with lower- or higher-than-average biomass dominate communities. In contrast, the complementarity effect is positive overall, supporting the hypothesis that plant diversity influences primary production in European grasslands through niche differentiation or facilitation.},

Recent theory attributes this to the ‘selection effect’ (dominance by species with particular traits), and the ‘complementarity effect’ (niche differentiation and/or facilitative interactions). Using the Price Equation, I show that the ‘selection effect’ only partially reflects dominance by species with particular traits at the expense of other species, and therefore is only partially analogous to natural selection. I then derive a new, tripartite partition of the difference between observed and expected ecosystem function. The ‘dominance effect’ is analogous to natural selection. ‘Trait-independent complementarity’ occurs when species function better than expected, independent of their traits and not at the expense of other species. ‘Trait-dependent complementarity’ occurs when species with particular traits function better than expected, but not at the expense of other species. I illustrate the application of this new partition using experimental data.},

	abstract = {Global biodiversity is declining at rates faster than at any other point in human history. Experimental manipulations at small spatial scales have demonstrated that communities with fewer species consistently produce less biomass than higher diversity communities. Understanding the consequences of the global extinction crisis for ecosystem functioning requires understanding how local experimental results are likely to change with increasing spatial and temporal scales and from experiments to naturally assembled systems. Scaling across time and space in a changing world requires baseline predictions. Here, we provide a graphical null model for area scaling of biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships using observed macroecological patterns: the species–area curve and the biomass–area curve. We use species–area and biomass–area curves to predict how species richness–biomass relationships are likely to change with increasing sampling extent. We then validate these predictions with data from two naturally assembled ecosystems: a Minnesota savanna and a Panamanian tropical dry forest. Our graphical null model predicts that biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships are scale-dependent. However, we note two important caveats. First, our results indicate an apparent contradiction between predictions based on measurements in biodiversity–ecosystem functioning experiments and from scaling theory. When ecosystem functioning is measured as per unit area (e.g. biomass per m2), as is common in biodiversity–ecosystem functioning experiments, the slope of the biodiversity ecosystem functioning relationship should decrease with increasing scale. Alternatively, when ecosystem functioning is not measured per unit area (e.g. summed total biomass), as is common in scaling studies, the slope of the biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationship should increase with increasing spatial scale. Second, the underlying macroecological patterns of biodiversity experiments are predictably different from some naturally assembled systems. These differences between the underlying patterns of experiments and naturally assembled systems may enable us to better understand when patterns from biodiversity–ecosystem functioning experiments will be valid in naturally assembled systems. Synthesis. This paper provides a simple graphical null model that can be extended to any relationship between biodiversity and any ecosystem functioning across space or time. Furthermore, these predictions provide crucial insights into how and when we may be able to extend results from small-scale biodiversity experiments to naturally assembled regional and global ecosystems where biodiversity is changing.},

	abstract = {The structure of the competitive network is an important driver of biodiversity and coexistence in natural communities. In addition to determining which species survive, the nature and intensity of competitive interactions within the network also affect the growth, productivity, and abundances of those individuals that persist. As such, the competitive network structure may likewise play an important role in determining community-level functioning by capturing the net costs of competition. Here, using an experimental system comprising 18 wood decay basidiomycete fungi, we test this possibility by quantifying the links among competitive network structure, species diversity, and community function. We show that species diversity alone has negligible impacts on community functioning, but that diversity interacts with two key properties of the competitive network—competitive intransitivity and average competitive ability—to ultimately shape biomass production, respiration, and carbon use efficiency. Most notably, highly intransitive communities comprising weak competitors exhibited a positive diversity–function relationship, whereas weakly intransitive communities comprising strong competitors exhibited a negative relationship. These findings demonstrate that competitive network structure can be an important determinant of community-level functioning, capturing a gradient from weakly to strongly competitive communities. Our research suggests that the competitive network may therefore act as a unifying link between diversity and function, providing key insight as to how and when losses in biodiversity will impact ecosystem function.},

In contrast to public green spaces, planning and management is usually uncoordinated and independent of municipal planning and management strategies. Therefore, the potential for private gardens to provide ecosystem services and habitat and to function as corridors for wildlife is not fully utilized. In order to improve public knowledge on gardens, as well as provide individual gardeners with information on what they can contribute to enhance ecosystem services provision, we developed a GIS-based web application for the city of Braunschweig (Germany): the \&lsquo;GartenApp\&rsquo; (garden app). Users of the app have to outline their garden on a web map and provide information on biodiversity related features and management practices. Finally, they are asked about observations of well recognizable species in their gardens. As an output, the gardeners are provided with an estimate of the ecosystem services their garden provides, with an evaluation of the biodiversity friendliness, customized advice on improving ecosystem services provision, and results from connectivity models that show gardeners the role of their garden in the green network of the city. In this paper, we describe the app architecture and show the first results from its application. We finish with a discussion on the potential of GIS-based web applications for urban sustainability, planning and conservation.},

	abstract = {Urban park patronage is intimately linked to the thermal comfort level perceived by visitors. This study quantified the effects of nine park-design and urban-landscape parameters on air temperature and relative humidity in summer by deploying 100 sensors in 14 urban parks in Hong Kong. The field data were compared with a reference weather station and analysed with multiple regression. The sampled parks were on average 0.2 °C warmer and 1.7\% less humid than the reference. A notable temperature reduction (mean = 0.6 °C and max. = 4.9 °C) was only observed in the largest park in Hong Kong. The daily variations in cooling and humidifying magnitudes were strongly dependent on background temperature. The distance from sea, shrub cover, tree cover and sky view factor were significant parameters that controlled temperature and relative humidity. Mean temperature could be predicted to cool by 0.6 °C if the park was 1 km closer to the sea. For every 10\% increase in shrub and tree covers, mean temperature would drop by 0.07 and 0.04 °C respectively. Larger parks with good coverage of woody vegetation should be developed to improve urban microclimate within parks and mediate the warming effect of nearby built-up areas.},

	abstract = {While urbanisation remains a major threat to biodiversity, urban areas can sometimes play an important role in protecting threatened species, especially exploited taxa such as parrots. The Hispaniolan Parakeet Psittacara chloropterus has been extirpated across much of Hispaniola, including from most protected areas, yet Santo Domingo (capital city of the Dominican Republic) has recently been found to support the island’s densest remaining population. In 2019, we used repeated transects and point-counts across 60 1 km2 squares of Santo Domingo to examine the distribution of parakeets, identify factors that might drive local presence and abundance, and investigate breeding ecology. Occupancy models indicate that parakeet presence was positively related to tree species richness across the city. N-Mixture models show parakeet encounter rates were correlated positively with species richness of trees and number of discrete ‘green’ patches ({\textgreater} 100 m2) within the survey squares. Hispaniolan Woodpecker Melanerpes striatus, the main tree-cavity-producing species on Hispaniola, occurs throughout the city, but few parakeet nests are known to involve the secondary use of its or other cavities in trees/palms. Most parakeet breeding (perhaps 50–100 pairs) appears to occur at two colonies in old buildings, and possibly only a small proportion of the city’s 1500+ parakeets that occupy a single roost in street trees breed in any year. Our models emphasise the importance of parks and gardens in providing feeding resources for this IUCN Vulnerable species. Hispaniola’s urban centres may be strongholds for populations of parakeets and may even represent sources for birds to recolonise formerly occupied areas on the island.},

	abstract = {Urban forests are associated with important ecosystem services, such as reduced environmental exposure and improved human health. These benefits will become even more important with climate change, especially with most humans now living in cities. Yet urban trees are themselves threatened by the changing climate, unprecedented urban growth and new exotic pests and diseases. Hence, to maintain the services provided by urban forests, developing efficient management practices becomes ever more important. Traditional practices often promote low-diversity tree communities to meet the demands of a taxing urban environment and preferences of citizens. However, these low-diversity communities are inherently more susceptible to collapse, as all trees may be eliminated or seriously affected following a single stressful event. Here we present an intuitively simple and user-friendly urban tree management approach that integrates the latest advances in functional ecology to minimize the risk of catastrophic urban tree mortality caused by future uncertain environmental conditions in order to maintain forest cover and preserve urban ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {To identify the soil carbon stock changes from croplands/grasslands to forestlands in Japan, we compared the soil carbon stock of a cropland/grassland with that of an adjacent forestland at 22 different sites. With respect to a 0–30-cm depth basis, the soil carbon stock in the cropland/grassland was the same as that in the forestland; however, it was less than that in the forestland when an equivalent mass approach was used. The ratio of the soil carbon stock in the forestland to that in the cropland/grassland was 1.11 on average, which is comparable with previous mass-corrected paired sampling studies. The ratio was affected by two factors: tree age and current vegetation. Mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, phosphate absorption coefficient, litter quantity, and former land use did not affect the ratio. According to a comparison with the results of a paired study for deforestation, the application of the reciprocal of the soil carbon stock ratio of deforestation to the ratio of afforestation was slightly overestimated. Further studies are necessary to establish a general conclusion. Some previous studies, including those involving non-mass-corrected data, are possibly biased, and more studies using the paired sampling method with equivalent mass basis must be conducted to provide the general factor for soil carbon stock change in the future.},

	abstract = {The exponential population growth of Karachi city has taken a very heavy toll on the indigenous environment of this South Asian megacity. In this context, the unlikely roadsides plantation of nonnative species by the city decision-makers was a short-term solution to cultivate green belts, ultimately, to improve city environment. However, this has backfired and become a very serious ecological crisis as the species become invasive alien species and destroyed the native ecological environment of the city significantly. This study provided an accurate spatial extent of invasive alien species and evaluated the intensity of the problem using remote sensing technology. Firstly, the importance value index was developed to highlight the intensity of invasive alien species in native plant communities. Afterwards, the hot spots were sampled to develop training areas for Object Based Image Analysis to map the extent of invasive alien species in the city using high-resolution GeoEye satellite imagery. The overall accuracy of mapping was 93.17\% with Kappa coefficient value of 0.904. In addition, to explore hyperspectral remote sensing analysis, two techniques—Derivative Vegetation Index and Spectral Angle Mapper—were employed on EO-I hyperspectral imagery to map invasive alien species using spectral signatures. The analysis revealed 99.94\% correlation between the two mapping techniques. Finally, to identify the impact of invasive alien species on the microclimate of the city, a spatiotemporal analysis (1992–2016) at selected sites was performed on Landsat thermal images. The study ruled out the concept of invasive alien species influence on the microclimate of the city as both vegetation growth and ambient air temperature change were not interdependent.},

	abstract = {Relatively little is known about the dynamics of tropical urban forests, their phylogenetic diversity, as well as the socioeconomic and ecological factors that influence overall diversity across the urban landscape. However, permanent forest inventory and monitoring plot networks are increasingly being established across forests and cities of the world to monitor structural and functional attributes of urban forests, as well as ecosystem services. We analyzed a tropical, coastal urban forest in San Juan, Puerto Rico using metrics of phylogenetic diversity (PD), plant diversity, and available permanent plot data from an urban forest inventory and monitoring system. In total, we found 152 species belonging to 119 genera and 44 families in San Juan. PD tended to be highest in forest remnant areas. We also explored correlations between socioeconomic factors and taxonomic diversity and found that plant species richness was correlated with population density and housing price. We found marginally significant relationships between housing price, population density, and several PD metrics. Our results further suggest mixed evidence of luxury and legacy effects, two factors that have been linked to the plant diversity of anthropogenic ecosystems in other research. Overall, despite centuries of human influence, the existing urban forest diversity in San Juan - although perhaps not the particular species composition - is likely to be primarily the result of climate, biome, and multi-scale socioeconomic contexts and not legacy effects. The approach used and findings from this study could be used to better understand the application of PD metrics for assessing urban biodiversity and other beneficial attributes and traits of urban forests.},

	abstract = {In early 2020, the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) led multiple countries to introduce strict lockdown measures to contain the pandemic. Movement restrictions may have influenced the ability of the public to contribute to citizen science projects. We investigated how stay-at-home orders affected data submitted by birdwatchers in Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom (UK) to a widely-used citizen science platform, iNaturalist, depending on whether observations were collected in urban or non-urban areas. We found significant trends in the daily number of observations in all three countries, indicating a surge in urban observation during lockdowns. We found an increase in the mean daily number of urban observations during the lockdown in Italy and Spain, compared to previous years. The mean daily number of non-urban observations decreased in Italy and Spain, while remained similar to previous years in the UK. We found a general decrease of new records during the lockdowns both in urban and non-urban areas in all countries. Our results suggest that the citizen science community remained active during the lockdowns and kept reporting birds from home. However, limitations to movements may have hampered the possibility of birdwatchers to explore natural areas and collect new records. Our findings suggest that future research and conservation applications of citizen science data should carefully consider the bias and gaps in data series caused by the pandemic. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential of urban areas for nature activities, such as birdwatching, and its relevance for sustainable urban planning.},

	abstract = {Streetlamps enforce night lighting on urban forest trees, but scarce information is available concerning the ecophysiological performance of street trees under these conditions. In this study, maple (Acer truncatum Bunge) and oak (Quercus mongolica Fisch. ex Ledeb.) seedlings were cultured with simulated exposure to streetlamp spectra in white (red/green/blue, 7.7:1.0:2.2) and red plus blue (RB; red/green/blue, 4.6:0.0:1.0) lights with photosynthetic photon flux rate of 80 μmol m-2 s-1 in a 18-h photoperiod. Nitrogen (N) was loaded through 15 weekly applications to an amount of 80 mg N plant-1 to mimic the mineral N deposition to landscape trees. Variables of biomass, carbohydrate accumulation, N and water contents were rarely found difference between the two LED-spectra treatments for both species. Compared to the un-lighted control, the RB spectrum lowered N concentration in oak seedlings and water content in maple seedlings. The white light spectrum resulted in an increase of starch concentration. Carbohydrate concentration had a positive relationship with biomass and N content across two species but a negative relationship with water content in maple seedlings. Overall, streetlamp-lights imposed effects on tree growth by a prolonged photoperiod instead of specific spectrum. Maple had a strong response of water uptake to streetlamp lighting at the cost of carbohydrate consumption, but oak had scarce demand of water-use for growth.},

	abstract = {Urban forests affect land surface temperature (LST) within a city due to the cooling effect of transpiration. The latter depends on tree health, but it can also be affected by the structure and composition of forest, as a mono-species environment may potentially worsen the health of urban forest. The following hypotheses are therefore proposed: a) greater tree diversity within urban forest results in lower LST at the city block scale; and b) the state of biotic disturbance of urban forest is negatively correlated with LST. The present research explores the relationship between urban forest tree diversity and health based on a survey of 38,950 individuals in the district of Providencia in the city of Santiago, Chile, and compares this information against LST data from the ASTER satellite instrument at the city block scale. The health of the urban forest was determined by expert knowledge means of a field survey that collected data concerning growth stage, phytosanitary state, and state of biotic disturbance. The first hypothesis could not be tested by the lack of urban tree diversity which showed strong domination of three species with more than 52 \% of abundance (Robinia pseudoacacia, Platanus orientalis and Acer negundo). The second hypothesis was proved since the results revealed a positive and significant correlation between urban forest diversity and LST, with a Spearman’s correlation coefficient of between 0.56 and 0.7. A positive and significant correlation of 0.55 was found between mean biotic disturbance (BDSm) and median LST (Med), indicating a direct relationship between higher LST and poorer urban forest health. A possible explanation is that, among the trees surveyed within the urban forest, the effect of biotic disturbance is greater than that of species diversity. As such, it may be concluded that planting of trees on city streets as a means of temperature moderation is made less effective if specimens are maintained in a poor general condition of health.},

	abstract = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) that use non-dominated sorting and sharing have been criticized mainly for: (1) their O(MN/sup 3/) computational complexity (where M is the number of objectives and N is the population size); (2) their non-elitism approach; and (3) the need to specify a sharing parameter. In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN/sup 2/) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed.},

Using open-source data on global tree inventories, this study examines (1) the diversity of species, genera, and family of urban street trees in eight cities internationally; (2) how they score on diversity benchmarks and indices; and (3) the diversity variation inside and outside of cities’ centers. We hypothesized most cities would score poorly on diversity benchmarks and spatial patterns in species composition would exist, as illustrated by established relationships between urban density and urban tree diversity. Results indicate city centers were less likely to approach the proposed diversity benchmarks than outside the city center. Overall, both Shannon and Simpson diversity indices show greater diversity outside of the city center, especially at the species-level. Understanding street tree diversity and spatial variation patterns across cities internationally can offer needed evidence to back up heuristic benchmarks. The methodology and open-source data used in this study are intended to enable practitioners better target tree diversity efforts.},

	abstract = {Knowledge about the level of public attention toward different species is crucial to successful conservation. The evolution of online social networks offers new possibilities for collecting data about public interest. Building on an analysis of text messages on Twitter, this study aimed to quantify the level of public attention toward different mammal and bird species listed (at the full species or subspecies/population level) under the United States’ Endangered Species Act (ESA). Once a month during 1 year, I searched recently posted messages (‘tweets’) for the common names of every listed species. The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) was by far the most tweeted species. The other most tweeted mammals were the American bison (Bison bison), brown bear (U. arctos), cougar (Puma concolor), killer whale (Orcinus orca), black bear (U. americanus) and West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), respectively. The three most frequently tweeted birds were the sandhill crane (Grus canadensis), whooping crane (G. americana) and spotted owl (Strix occidentalis). Some species, such as the manatee, right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), and gray wolf (Canis lupus) ranked higher when restricting the search to conservation contexts. The results suggest that Twitter users interact about a biased sample of ESA-listed species: mammals were better represented than birds among the most tweeted species and larger-sized species received more tweets. The findings can be used for prioritizing conservation education and marketing campaigns aiming to raise the profile of lesser-known listed species. Data from online social networks open the door for a range of novel applications in conservation science.},

Here, we used Twitter and the Hedonometer, a world analysis tool, to investigate how sentiment, or the estimated happiness of the words people write, varied before, during, and after visits to San Francisco's urban park system. We found that sentiment was substantially higher during park visits and remained elevated for several hours following the visit. Leveraging differences in vegetative cover across park types, we explored how different types of outdoor public spaces may contribute to subjective well-being. Tweets during visits to Regional Parks, which are greener and have greater vegetative cover, exhibited larger increases in sentiment than tweets during visits to Civic Plazas and Squares. Finally, we analysed word frequencies to explore several mechanisms theorized to link nature exposure with mental and cognitive benefits. Negation words such as ‘no’, ‘not’, and ‘don't’ decreased in frequency during visits to urban parks. These results can be used by urban planners and public health officials to better target nature contact recommendations for growing urban populations.

	abstract = {The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) commits its 196 nation parties to conserve biological diversity, use its components sustainably, and share fairly and equitably the benefits from the utilization of genetic resources. The last of these objectives was further codified in the Convention's Nagoya Protocol (NP), which came into effect in 2014. Although these aspirations are laudable, the NP and resulting national ambitions on Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) of genetic resources have generated several national regulatory regimes fraught with unintended consequences (1). Anticipated benefits from the commercial use of genetic resources, especially those that might flow to local or indigenous communities because of regulated access to those resources, have largely been exaggerated and not yet realized. Instead, national regulations created in anticipation of commercial benefits, particularly in many countries that are rich in biodiversity, have curtailed biodiversity research by in-country scientists as well as international collaboration (1). This weakens the first and foremost objective of the CBD—conservation of biological diversity. We suggest ways that the Conference of the Parties (CoP) of the CBD may proactively engage scientists to create a regulatory environment conducive to advancing biodiversity science.

With 336 million active users as of 2018, Twitter is a social network that is increasingly used in research to get information and to understand public opinion as exemplified by Twitter users. In order to identify the factors related to the sustainable care of environment and public health, we have downloaded n = 5873 tweets that used the hashtag \#WorldEnvironmentDay on the respective day. As the next step, sentiment analysis with an algorithm developed in Python and trained with data mining was applied to the sample of tweets to group them according to the expressed feelings. Thereafter, a textual analysis was used to group the tweets according to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), identifying the key factors about environment and public health that most concern Twitter users. To this end, we used the qualitative analysis software NVivo Pro 12. The results of the analysis enabled us to establish the key factors that most concern users about the environment and public health such as climate change, global warming, extreme weather, water pollution, deforestation, climate risks, acid rain or massive industrialization. The conclusions of the present study can be useful to companies and institutions that have initiatives related to the environment and they also facilitate decision-making regarding the environment in non-profit organizations. Our findings will also serve the United Nations that will thoroughly review the 17 SDGs at the High-level Political Forum in 2019.},

	abstract = {Charismatic megafauna are arguably considered the primary attractor of ecotourists to sub-Saharan African protected areas. However, the lack of visitation data across the whole continent has thus far prevented the investigation of whether charismatic species are indeed a key attractor of ecotourists to protected areas. Social media data can now be used for this purpose. We mined data from Instagram, and used generalized linear models with site- and country-level deviations to explore which socio-economic, geographical and biological factors explain social media use in sub-Saharan African protected areas. We found that charismatic species richness did not explain social media usage. On the other hand, protected areas that were more accessible, had sparser vegetation, where human population density was higher, and that were located in wealthier countries, had higher social media use. Interestingly, protected areas with lower richness in non-charismatic species had more users. Overall, our results suggest that more factors than simply charismatic species might explain attractiveness of protected areas, and call for more in-depth content analysis of the posts. With African countries projected to develop further in the near-future, more social media data will become available, and could be used to inform protected area management and marketing.},

Also, their environmental knowledge showed to be based on a visual perception, rather than on a cognitive one, as marine litter was considered a great environmental problem, while invasive species and biofouling went unnoticed, remarking the lack of an effective communication from scientific sources.},

Here, I review urban large carnivore management and its human dimension and discuss how to create a model of harmonious coexistence that includes both management of human—brown bear conflict (HBC) and conservation of the lush, green environment of Sapporo. Although large carnivores that use urban landscapes can temporarily obtain an abundance of high-energy foods, they are also subject to high rates of human-derived mortality. Brown bear invasions of the city center of Sapporo are still rare and are likely caused by bear population increase and distribution expansion within the last decade. It is important to manage urban borders to reduce their attractiveness. A verdant environment and biodiversity conservation are considered to be important to urban residents in Sapporo. Urban HBC, however, is an unavoidable consequence of this style of living. Because a variety of stakeholders affected by HBC and its management live in the city, their various values should be reflected in wildlife management policy through a more collaborative, community-based decision-making model.},

	abstract = {We proposed a mapping method for landscape aesthetic demand and potential supply area based on viewsheds, which is a direct method that provides robust results. Moreover, we mapped the aesthetic value of Hokkaido as a case study in Asia. The Aichi Biodiversity Target refers to the importance of ecosystem service (ES) mapping methodologies. However, ES mapping in policy and practice has rarely been reported. Robust, reliable indicators are required. Recently, studies estimating aesthetic value have used geotagged photos on social networking services instead of survey results of user preferences. The methods used in these studies were cost effective and provided spatially explicit results. However, these methods used the photography positions. Using the photographed sites is a more direct method to estimate the aesthetic demand. Therefore, we used geotagged photos on Flickr and viewsheds from each photography position to identify the photographed sites. The demand area was estimated using the viewshed. The potential supply area was estimated using MaxEnt. The demand and potential supply areas were concentrated in natural parks. Comparing the demand and potential supply areas indicates areas with potential supply despite their low demand in forest, farmland, and natural parks. This method will contribute to CES research and decision-making.},
