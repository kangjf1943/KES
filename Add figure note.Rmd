Text: Here is the text for the article. 

```{r CarPlot, fig.cap="CarPlot \n note:aaa", echo=FALSE}
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist)
```

<!-- 当然也可以在图后面加文字 -->
*Note: Here the note for the figure above. * 


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:  Figure \ref{fig:pressure}.
```{=latex}
\begin{figure}[t]
```
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
```{=latex}
\caption{Air quality monitors across India. \label{fig:pressure}}
\textit{Notes:} Dots denote cities with monitoring stations
under India's National Ambient Air Monitoring Programme
(NAAMP).  Geographical data are drawn from MIT's Geodata
Repository.
\end{figure}
```
